   MASTER THESIS DIRECTION AND OTHER GRADUATE COMMITTEE WORK:
Note: The first three were started under my direction when I was at
Kent State University on a research leave from Hiram College. The
students requested that I continue as an unofficial thesis director
even though an outside professor cannot officially chair a
supervisory committee at KSU. Consequently, a KSU professor was
listed as the official chair.

     DIRECTION OF UNDERGRADUATE PROJECTS: From 1974 until 1995, all
computer science majors at Hiram College designed and implemented
a major research project and presented it to the faculty and other
students both orally and in a paper. I directed over two-thirds of
the projects during that time. To list all the projects would
require many pages. Below I have shown a representative sample of
some of those projects, namely ones from 1985-86, by giving the
title and a very brief description of the work.

John Choma, "Automatic Theorem Proving".
     Converted an INTERLISP theorem prover of W. Bledsoe to COMMON
LISP and used the prover to demonstrate automatic theorem proving
techniques.

William Filion, "Story Generating Programs".
     Wrote a story generator using agendas.

Pat Gintert, "Collecting and Analyzing Experimental Data".
     Interfaced an Apple IIe to several physics laboratory
experiments to automatically collect and analyze experimental data.

Chad Hegerty:, "Robotic Arm Movements".
     Investigated the geometric constraints of robotic arm
movements and compared theoretical work in this area with existing
industrial robotic arms.

Howard Kimney, III, " Analyzing the Performance of an Operating
System"
     Conducted an investigation of the campus VAX-VMS operating
system as configured and suggested improvements.

Christopher Kovach, "Shading and Lighting in Graphics Displays".
     Compared several models for lighting and shading by using
greytoning techniques on a GIGI.

Sandra Marxen, "Software Reliability and Technical Problems of Star
Wars"
     Translated the technical problems of software reliability into
terms that the general public can understand.

Greg Merz, "Proving Programs Correct".
     Demonstrated many of the basic techniques by proving several
programs correct.

Karen Muehlhauser, "Poetry Generation- A Comparison of Current
Techniques"
     Wrote a poetry generator in COMMON LISP. The output was highly
praised by our resident poet, Professor Hale Chatfield.

Paul Stephan, "Parallel Sorting Algorithms".
     Compared and analyzed the complexity of parallel sorting
algorithms.

Robert Switalski, "Expert System Generating Using OPS5"
     Implemented an expert system for identifying chemical
compounds in a beginning chemistry laboratory. Worked with a
chemistry professor to test the system.


Robert Vance, "Implementing Languages as Threaded Code".
     Implemented FORTH on the VAX 11-780.

Catherine Vishnevsky, "Fractals:.
     Investigated the mathematical foundations of fractal geometry
and demonstrated the use of 2D fractals by generating graphics
displays.

     I also introduced "project courses" in artificial
intelligence, graphics, and compiler writing. These courses
required each student to design and implement a major research
project and present it to the faculty and other students both
orally and in a paper. In 1995, we decided to require each student
to take two of these courses instead of a senior seminar. I have
included the listing of the talks for the artificial intelligence
course in 1995 as representation of these projects.

You are invited to the 3rd Artificial Intelligence Seminar
presented by the students in CPSC 355: Artificial Intelligence. At
the two evening sessions, students will present, discuss, and
demonstrate prototype artificial intelligence systems that they
have built during the quarter.

The following is the schedule for the talks on Tuesday and
Wednesday of this week:

     Tuesday, March 7: Talks: 7-9:30, H-203
          7:00  John L. Fleming

          8:00  Jacalyn M. Halle
               An expert system for playing interactive Pente.
          8:30  Kelley A. Pellini
               Using frames to explore simple relationships between
               characters in a story, "Gone With the Wind".
          9:00  Darren T. Mancuso
               An expert system for choosing first aid remedies.

     Wednesday, March 8: Talks 7-9:00, H-203
          7:00  Steve J. Haley
               A genetic algorithm for solving the knapsack
               problem.
