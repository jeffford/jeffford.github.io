<EM><B>I. A formal proposal for your project.- Due <FONT COLOR="red">Sunday, January 21 in an email message</FONT>
		as an attached Word document. Earlier is even better.</B></EM>
		<P>This should be a detailed narrative (i.e. don't just list answers to the questions below) of how you envision
		your project. Explain <BR>
		1) What you plan to model- to the best of your knowledge right now. <BR>
		2) Why this project is of interest to you. <BR>
		3) Specify any web sites, journal articles, or individuals you have consulted about your topic. <BR>
		4)Explain why you feel you have the knowledge to understand the scenario you are proposing. <BR>
		5) Describe how you plan to implement the project in stages. <BR>
		<BR>
		A staged approach is VERY critical as you will want to have a working project available throughout your entire
		development. It is critical that you start simple and add complexity to later versions. Always keep a WORKING version
		of your project safe (multiple backups are a good idea) and work on a copy to add enhancements. If you tell me
		at the presentation time that you had a working version last week and now it doesn't work, I will assume you have
		done nothing and your grade will be the same! <BR>
		<BR>
		Be sure to write your proposal and your paper in good, scientific sytle --- i.e. no &quot;I's&quot;. Imagine yourself
		convincing your client (or boss) that you are the one to design the simulation for this project and that it is
		a project worth doing. <BR>
		<BR>
		I am aware that you may be changing your ideas during the course of your development. That is fine, but if you
		don't have an initial vision of your project, you won't make any progress. Major changes should be discussed with
		me. <BR>
		<BR>
		You are welcome to chat informally with me about possible projects. Almost all informal proposals needed some refinement
		and massaging. You will still need to submit a formal proposal.<BR>
		<BR>
		To get ideas, look at web sites, and look at the examples in the book, especially those mentioned in Appendix B.
		To see spcifications on these problems, look on the right panel for Contest Problems on the <A HREF="http://www.arenasimulation.com/programs/sim_w_arena_4.asp">Arena
		textbook web site.<BR>
		</A><BR>
		You may use a scenario from the Contest Problems, but you will have to enhance or change it. If you choose that
		route, you should be able to give a clearer idea of how you will stage your project. <BR>
		<BR>
		If you don't use an existing scenario from the Contest Problems, you should concentrate more on describing the
		scenario you plan to model. The more detail you provide the better. <BR>
		
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<I><B>II. If I give you some feedback that requires additional explanations on your part, the final proposal will
		be due no later than Wednesday, January 24.</B></I></P>
		<P>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<I><B>III.<FONT COLOR="red"> On each Sunday following the time your proposal is accepted through April 1 inclusively</FONT>,
		send mail describing what you have accomplished on your project during the previous week. This can be an informal
		email.</B></I></P>
		<P>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<I><B>IV. An abstract of your project including the title must be sent by email by Sunday, April 1. It is important
		that these are received on time so I can advertize your presentation.</B></I></P>
		<P>Some sample abstracts from other courses are given below. Watch your spelling and grammar as I will NOT correct
		anything!</P>

<I><B>V. Your poster that will be hung in the corridor at Colton is due by Sunday, April 1 For details about how
		to make these, see <A HREF="DirectionsPosters.doc">Poster Directions.</A><FONT COLOR="red"> </FONT>Samples are
		available here as templates: <A HREF="9Adam.ppt">Example 1</A> and <A HREF="hgiflowchart.ppt">Example 2</A>.</B></I></P>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><I>VI. Your paper and your working project will be <FONT COLOR="red">due by Monday, April 2, in class</FONT><FONT
		SIZE="4">.</FONT></I></B></P>
		<P>Hand in a hard copy of your paper, your powerpoint slides, your abstract, your poster, and all your model code
		on a CD. Note that this is due in the last week of classes. If you miss this deadline, I will accept a draft of
		your paper in class Monday, April 2 although you will be penalized for late submissions at the rate of 3% per day.
		The very latest I can accept the final CD is by the final exam day on Wednesday, April 11 at 1pm, but the penalty
		will be huge.</P>
		<P>Paper specifics: See <A HREF="paper.doc">details</A>.<IMG SRC="blinknew.gif" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM"

		<P><IMG SRC="blinknew.gif" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">Some sample journal articles appear
		here. These are not student papers and are supplied only to allow you to see some posssibilities of what to include.
		Be sure to follow the directions given in the details above as some specifications for this course are slightly
		different than those followed by the authors here as different journals have different guidelines. Three are simulation
		papers and two are graphics papers. You should look at all them although I don't expect you to read all of them
		in detail.</P>

<B><I>VII. A talk of 20 minutes in length with 10 minutes for questions will be presented on <FONT COLOR="red">Wednesday
		and Thursday evenings, April 4 and 5.</FONT> Specific times and days will be chosen later.</I></B></P>
		<P>All students in the CPSC 361 course are encouraged to attend some of the presentations.CPSC 400/401 students
		are required to attend. Friends and family are welcome to attend, also. I will have a class before that time to
		talk more about what is expected of you for this talk. Be sure to organize your talk so you can pack a lot of information
		AND a short demo into the time.
