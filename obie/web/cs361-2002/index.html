<H2>Homework Assignments:</H2>
<h3> Homework Policy: </h3>
<p> Writeup the results of your work on the exercise. These will be collected 
1 week after the assignment is made, although I may only check that you have done something
on the assignment--- i.e. you did the exercises or not. Your results need not be correct, but 
they must show you did work on the problem.</p>
<p> After the papers are returned, I may ask for volunteers to discuss or show their solutions. 
At this point you can earn "homework" points. I encourage you to show what you have done, even
if you are not sure it is correct! I am impressed by someone who is honestly trying the problems. </p>

<li> Take Home Part of Exam: Do Exercise 3-4 on page 96. Mail the .doe file and the .doc file explaining your answer 
to csgrader@hiram.edu by noon on Saturday. Note this corrects the handout in class which said 3-1 and extends the 
deadline by 12 hours because of the lag time before the error was brought to my attention.

March 29 in cpscgrader in an email message(s)[1 for each problem] with appropriate .doe and .doc files: Exercises
