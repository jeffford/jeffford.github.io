<h3> Your deliverables for this course will
 be:</h3>
 <hr>
 <ol> <em>A formal proposal for your project.- Due week 2 </em></ol>
<p> This must be approximately a 2 page discussion of how you envision your project. Explain
	<br>1) What you plan to implement- to the best of your knowledge right now.
	<br>2) Why this project is of interest to you.
	<br>3) Specify any web sites or journal articles you have explored that are 
about your topic.
	<br>4) Describe how you plan to implement the project in stages. 
	
<br>	<br> A staged approach
is VERY critical as you will want to have a working project available throughout
your entire development. Remember, start simple and add complexity to later versions.
 Always keep a WORKING version of your project safe (multiple backups are a good idea)
 and work on a copy to add enhancements. If you tell me at the presentation time that
 you had a working version last week and now it doesn't work, I will assume you have 
 done nothing and your grade will be the same! 
<br><br>Be sure to write your proposal and your paper in good, scientific sytle --- 
i.e. no "I's". 
<br><br> I am aware that you may be changing your ideas during the course of your
development. That is fine, but if you don't have an initial vision of your project,
you won't make any progress.
<br><br> Many of you have chatted with me informally about possible projects. Almost all informal proposals needed some refinement and massaging. If you haven't interacted with me at all about possible ideas, I suggest you do so quickly. A mail message is fine.
<br><br> To get ideas, look at web sites and examine the code in the demo programs on the
cpsc 387 web site.
<br><br> You may be able to adapt some existing code provided you:
<br>1) Document the source of every single line you use that is not yours in a way that I can find easily the original code and see
it. Failure to do this will be a plagarism violation.
<br> 2) You have added a <em> substantial </em> amount of coding that can demonstrate your ability
to code a large project. If in doubt, ask me before you assume you have done enough on your own. If a lot  of your code is from another source, you have not met the requirements of this course. 
<br><br><em>This Project Proposal is due by Friday, 1/19/01 in a mail message to me. I prefer a text version extracted
from a Word document, not a Word attachment.</em> 
 <hr>
 <ol> A revised proposal, if necessary. - Due week 3 </ol>
 <ol> A project which you will design, develop, and code - Due the last
 week </ol>
 <ol> An abstract of your project - Due two days before your
 presentation </ol>
 <ol> A paper written in a journal style- Due two days before your
 presentation (See samples provided in on this site.) Use your best scientific
 style writing. </ol>
 <ol> A talk of 20 minutes in length. There will be an additional 10 minutes for
 questioning. Be sure to organize your talk so you can pack a lot of
 information AND a short demo into the time. </ol>
 <ol> <em> IMPORTANT </em> Send all of your source code, texture files,
 and anything needed to compile an run your code to cpscgrader@hirma.edu before
 the final starts on Wednesday 4/11. I will compile and run the code so do NOT send .dsw 
 files!! </ol>
 <ol> I will make an appointment with you during the 3 week to discuss your 
 work which will include your entire project---implementation, code, paper, 
 presentation, and the general level of your work.  </ol><br>

<h3> The following pages are from the previous course (with names of
presenters removed).</h3>
<p>These will act as background material you might
find useful to see the scope of the projects. The "Description for our
guests" shows the purpose of the projects and the Abstracts show some of
the projects done last time. The Form may be modified slightly, but the
basic structure will be the same. 
<h4> About the Presentations: </h4>
<li><a href="reports.html"> Description for our guests. </a> 

<h4> Abstracts of Projects: </h4>
<p> Comment made in 1998: I did not edit any of the abstracts so if you see spelling or
grammar errors now, and some of you should ;-), it is too late!
<p> Comment made 1/10/2001: Not all projects were acceptable, but most
of
the difficulties where due to a failure to carry out the project
in a reasonable fashion (due to waiting too long to start coding), rather than a failure of the original scope of
the project.
