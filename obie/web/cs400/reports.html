FOR OUR GUESTS:

     In order for you to understand the presentations being given
tonight, this will provide a bit of background material.

     The presentations are being made by students enrolled in CPSC
387: Computer Graphics this semester. Graphics is a branch of
computer science. Many people confuse graphics with image
processing. Graphics is the creation of pictures using the computer
without any graphical input in the form of camera images while
image processing takes camera images and manipulates them.
     Many of you have seen examples of both in the movies and on
television, particularly in ads. To the untrained eye, it is
difficult to determine whether graphics or image processing is
being used to obtain a particular image. Realize that the students
that will be presenting work tonight have just been studying
graphics for this term, so don't expect movie quality images. In
fact, many of the images you see on film are rendered, drawn on the
screen, over hours of time. Many of the images you will see tonight
are being generated in real-time on PCs, rather than high-end
graphics devices. Yet I think you will find some of the results
obtained are impressive. Realize, however, that in eleven weeks of
study and development, it is impossible to produce an extremely
complicated project. Be sure that you realize the following as you
listen:

1. The presentations are being given as if they were research paper
presentations at a professional meeting.

     This means that each student will:

     a. Have only 20 minutes to present his or her work and 10
minutes will be available for questions and answers. The total must
fit into 30 minutes.
          Please feel free to ask questions, however. In fact, many
questions show that you found the project interesting.

     b. Present overviews of the work done, not detailed
explanations, of the work.
          If you are interested in details, ask the student
questions in the question and answer period, stay for refreshments
and ask more questions during that time, and ask to read the
student's paper (which will be available next term, if the student
allows me to make it available).

     c. Assume he or she is talking to people with a background in
graphics.
          As some of our guests may not have this background, if
you need clarification, don't hesitate to ask during the question
and answer period or during refreshments.


     d. Try to interest the audience in exploring his or her
research further.
          This is really one point of presenting a paper at a
professional meeting. Another point is to announce results.

2. Each project was chosen with the following guidelines in mind:

     a. It was to use three dimensional techniques.

     b. It was to demonstrate that a chosen approach was feasible
to solve the selected problem, but it was not necessary to produce
a complete, robust system that could handle all contingencies.
          The idea was to demonstrate a prototype upon which a more
complete, robust system could be constructed (given more time than
was available in one semester). Remember the students had to
formulate their research area within the first three weeks of the
course and they had only eight weeks remaining in which to build or
utilize their systems. In many projects, the techniques used were
being presented in class during the time the students were working
on their projects.

     I am sure the students would welcome any comments you would be
willing to make on the attached Project Presentation Evaluation
Form. (Students in the class MUST fill these out). The form will
not be used by me for grading purposes. Comments are to aid the
student in perfecting his or her presentation skills. Please write
your name on form and give them to me. The forms will be returned
to the presenting student in xeroxed form with your name not
reproduced. I want the names on the original form so I can comment
to the students about their evaluations of the other presentations.

     Hope you enjoy the presentations!

                                             O. Slotterbeck
