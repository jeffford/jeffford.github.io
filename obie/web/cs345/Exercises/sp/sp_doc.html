<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
The Starving Philosophers simulation is based on the 
classical Dining Philosophers problem.
Each philosopher is in one of the states: Thinking, Hungry,
or Eating.
In this simulation probability distributions are specified for 
each philosopher giving the eating times and thinking times.
<p>
We start with all philosophers thinking and each determines a 
length of time from its thinking distribution.  After that time
the philosopher enters the hungry state and the algorithm determines
when it can enter its eating state.
<p>
When a philosopher enters its eating state, it
chooses an eating time from its eating time distribution and 
stays eating for this time.  When the time is up it goes into
the thinking state, possibly allowing others to eat.
<p>
Simulator times are integers on an arbitrary time scale.
The simulator is event driven.  As time progresses, the 
philosopher threads move among various queues as they attempt
to gain the monitor lock.
<p>
A unique color is used for each philosopher thread.  The philosophers
appear as boxes of a given color distributed around a black circle which
represents the monitor.  Inside each philosopher box is a letter (T, H, or E)
representing the state of the philosopher.  A philosopher thread attempting to
enter the monitor is shown as a solid rectangle of the philosopher color.
The simulator can animate the movement of this thread among the monitor queues
using this rectangle.
<p>
Inside the monitor circle are the monitor lock at the center and two monitor
queues, the <b>entry queue</b> containing threads which are attempting to 
execute a monitor routine and waiting for the monitor lock, and the
<b>waiting queue</b> consisting of those threads which have executed a 
condition variable wait and have been awakened.
<p>
In the Dining Philosophers algorithms used hear, there is one condition
variable per philosopher and only the corresponding philosopher can issue a 
wait for this condition variable.  The queues for these condition variables
and therefore have at most one waiting process.  These queues are shown
as small squares having the color of the corresponding philosopher.
When the queue is empty, the box has a white interior.  Otherwise, the 
box is filled with the color of the philosopher.
<p>
The philosophers are numbered starting at 0 with the one at 12 o'clock and
the numbers increase as you move clockwise around.  Figure 1 shows a diagram
of 5 philosophers.  Philosopher 0 (green) is thinking.  Philosophers
1 (red) and 3 (magenta) are hungry and are waiting on their condition
variables.  Philosophers 2 (blue) and 4 (cyan) are eating.

<p>
The simulator can run one of two dining philosophers algorithms and 
simulate monitors with 3 queue priorities and 3 queue disciplines.
Results of the simulation can be logged, graphed, and compared.
<p>
One area of interest is how long a philosopher remains in the hungry state.
The classical definition of starvation refers to a thread that is postponed
indefinitely from a desired activity, in this case changing from hungry
to eating.  We look at a more practical aspect of starvation, and assign
to each philosopher a maximum hungry time.  If a philosopher remains in the
hungry state longer than this time, we consider the philosopher starved,
and therefore no longer active.  The simulator can be run either with this
type of starvation on or off.  The default is off.
<p>
The simulator is written using the Jeli library.  Information about using the
widgets of this library can be found <a href=../Jeli/widgets.html>here</a>.

</p><h3>System and User Requirements</h3>
<p>
System requirements:
</p><ul><li>
    Computer with a Java runtime environment, version 1.1 or later.<br>
    Java 1.4.2 or later is recommended.
    </li><li>You need the following files to run the simulator:
            <ul><li><tt>SP.jar</tt>
            <li><tt>Jeli.jar</tt>
            <li><tt>spconfig</tt>
            <li><tt>runsp.bat </tt>(for Windows) or <tt>runsp</tt>
                 for UNIX or Mac OSX
        </ul>
</ul>    
<p>
User requirements:
</p><ul><li>Familiarity with running a program in a command line environment
    <li>Some knowledge of the Dining Philosophers Problem.
</ul>
 
<p>
If you are only interested in this simulator, you can download a zip file
<a href="http://vip.cs.utsa.edu/downloads/sp.zip">sp.zip</a>
that contains all of the files that you need.
<p>
<b>Running in a non-Windows environment:</b><br>
If you installed the simulator by copying the files from a CD, the
scripts may not have the correct permissions to run.  The <tt>convert</tt>
and <tt>runsp</tt> files should be executable.<br>
The ASCII files distributed with this distribution are in the Windows format
in which lines end in a carriage return followed by a line feed.
It may be more convenient to have the carriage returns removed.
If you are running under UNIX, Linux, or Mac OSX, it
may be more convenient to have the carriage returns removed.
You can remove all of the carriage returns from these files by executing the
<tt>convert</tt> script.
<p>

 
<hr>
<a name="Starting"></a>
<h3>Starting the Simulator</h3>
If you are running from an image of the simulator CD, start in the
<tt>sp</tt> subdirectory of the <tt>run</tt> directory.  If you unzipped
the <b>SP.zip</b> file in a single directory, start in that directory.
In either case, you can start the simulator from a command window by
executing typing <tt>runsp</tt>.  In a Windows environment you can
also just click on the file <tt>runsp.bat</tt>.
<p>
If you do a custom installation, you can put the jar files anywhere you
want.  Modify the <tt>runsp.bat</tt> (Windows) or <tt>runsp</tt>
(Unix, Linux, Mac OSX) file so that the <tt>JARDIR1</tt> or <tt>JARDIR2</tt>
variables points to the location of the jar files.
<p>
If the simulator does not start, make sure you have the Java runtime
executables in your path.  In a command window, execute:<br>
<tt>java -version</tt><br>
and make sure this displays a version later than 1.0.
<p>

<a name="Basic Operation"></a>
<h3>Basic Operation</h3>

The basic steps in doing a simulation are
<UL>
<LI> Create a configuration file describing the basic properties of the 
     simulator.
<LI> Start the simulator.
<LI> Use the simulator buttons to further modify the properties of the
     simulator.
<LI> Open the log file.
<LI> Run the simulator for a while.
<LI> Log the results.
<LI> Close the log file.
<LI> Exit the simulator.
<LI> Examine the log file using a browser.
</UL>

<p>
Start with the provided spconfig file.
The first line starts with the word <b>user</b>.
Modify this line so that your name appears after this word.
Start the simulator by executing <b>runsp</b> as described above.
You should see a window similar to the one shown in Figure 2.
The display consists of two parts, a diagram of the philosophers and the
monitor as in Figure 1, and a collection of buttons to control the simulation
below.

<p>

<p>
The buttons that control the animation have a light red background.
The simulator uses animation and a virtual time that is controlled by the
buttons and sliders above the <b>Pause</b> button.  Pushing the 
<b>Animation On</b> button changes it to an <b>Animation Off</b> button
and turns off the animation, allowing the simulation to run more quickly.
When on, the speed of animation is controlled by the speed slider.  The
detailed operation of this Jeli slider is described 
<a href=../Jeli/widgets.html>here</a>.
When animation is running, the <b>Pause</b> pauses the animation and
changes to a <b>Resume</b> button.
<p>
The simulation is run by pushing one of the 4 green buttons in the button area.
<b>Step Time</b> will run one time step.
<b>Step Event</b> will run the next time step in which something happens.
<b>Run: 10</b> will run 10 time steps.  It will count down the number of
remaining time steps as the simulation progresses.  The button below this,
<b>Run Count: 10</b> can be used to change the number of time steps that
the <b>Run</b> button executes.  Its operation is described
<a href=../Jeli/widgets.html>here</a>.
The last button, <b>Run Until Starvation</b> will run until a philosopher
starves (if starvation is on) or forever otherwise.  However, running can
always be stopped by pushing the <b>abort</b> button.  Abort will stop
the simulation after the current time step.
<p>
The buttons related to logging have a light blue background.
The <b>Open Log</b> button will open a log file containing information
about the simulation.  You can display a Gantt chart showing the states 
of the philosophers with the <b>Gantt Chart</b> button.  If the log is open,
the <b>Log</b> button on the Gantt chart will be active, allowing a copy of the
Gantt chart to be put in the log file.
<p>
When done with the simulation, close the log using the <b>Close Log</b> button
(which the <b>Open Log</b> button turned into) and exit the simulator using
the <b>Quit</b> button which is in the upper right corner of the 
philosophers diagram.
<p>
The rest of the buttons control the details of the algorithms used in the
simulation and the logging facility.  Both are described in detail below.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="Configuration"></a>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
Configuration is done using a configuration file.  The default name
of this file is <tt>spconfig</tt> but a different file can be used by
entering it on the command line when the program is started:<br>
<tt> java StarvingMain configfilemame</tt><p>
The configuration file consists of lines containing a keyword followed
by an optional parameter.  The parameter may represent a number, a probability distribution, or a string.
The order of the lines in the configuration file is not important except
for conflicting options.  In this case the later one has precedence.
<p>
The probability distributions support are constant, uniform, and exponential.
The probability distributions represent am integral time and cannot be negative.
The probability distributions have one of the following forms:<br>
&nbsp&nbsp <b>constant n</b> where n is a positive integer<br>
&nbsp&nbsp <b>uniform n m</b> meaning uniformly distributed between n and m inclusive.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp <b>exponential x</b> where <b>x</b> and be a floating point 
number representing the mean of the distribution.  Values from this distribution
are rounded up to an integer.
<p>

The following keywords are supported.  For the parameter, <b>n</b> and <b>m</b>
represent integers, <b>s</b> represents a string, and <b>d</b>
represents a distribution as described above.<p>
<tt><b>number n</b></tt><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the number of philosophers
<p>

<a name="Algorithms"></a>
<h3>Algorithms, Monitor Classification and Queueing Disciplines</h3>

The simulator supports two Dining Philosophers algorithms.
<p>
The classical algorithm is the one described in most textbooks.
When a philosopher stops eating, it examines it neighbors and lets them
eat if they are hungry and their other neighbor is not eating.
The Polite Algorithm does not allow a philosopher to eat twice in a row if
a neighbor has been hungry since it last started eating.
The default is to use the classical algorithm.  This can be changed
with a line in the configuration file or by pushing the <b>Algorithm</b>
button.
<p>
Monitors are classified by the relative priority of their queues.
The simulator assumes that the signaler queue has the highest priority.
The classification describes the relative priorities of the entry 
and waiting queues.  Monitors in which the waiting queue has the higher 
priority than the entry queue are called <b>Signal and Continue</b>
monitors and those in which the two queues have equal priority are called
<b>Wait and Notify</b> monitors.  Monitors in which the entry queue has 
higher priority than the waiting queue are generally thought to have
unacceptable behavior and do not have a standard name.  They are called
<b>Entry Priority</b> monitors here.
<p>
The classification of the monitor can be changed with a line in the 
configuration file or by pushing the monitor classification button
which is labeled by the name of the current classification.
<p>
The queueing discipline of a queue refers to the order in which items are
removed from the queue relative to the order in which they entered.  Three
queueing disciplines are supported by the simulator, FIFO, LIFO, and Random.
These refer to both the entry queue and the waiting queue.  The queueing 
discipline can be changed with a line in the configuration file or by
pushing the <b>Queueing</b> button.

<p>

<a name="Animation"></a>
<h3>Animation</h3>
Animation is controlled by the widgets with a light red background that are
at the bottom of the starving philosophers frame.  Animation is enabled when 
the <b>Animation On</b> button appears.  Pushing this buttons changes it to
<b>Animation Off</b> and turns off the animation.  The simulation will run much
faster with the animation off.
<p>
The speed of the animation can be controlled by a slider.  The relative speed 
of the animation is shown on the <b>Speed</b> button to the right of the
animation button.  Normal speed is 1.0.  It can be adjusted using the slider
to the right.  The <b>Round</b> button can be used to round the speed value
after it is adjusted with the slider.  The <b>Double</b> and <b>Round</b>
buttons control the range of the slider.
<p>
Below these is the <b>Pause/Resume</b> button.  When it says <b>Pause</b>
pushing this button will pause the animation which also pauses the
simulation.  The button is changed to a <b>Resume</b> button which resumes
the animation.  This button has no effect if animation if off.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="Logging"></a>
<h3>Logging</h3>
Logging is controlled by the buttons with a light blue background.
Some of these buttons have different functions depending on whether
the log file is open or not.
<p>
The <b>Open Log</b> button will open the log file.  This will change it to
a <b>Close Log</b> button.  When the log is not open, the next two
buttons affect what will happen when the log is opened next.  The
<b>Change Log Filename</b> button can be used to prompt you for a new
log filename.  The next button toggles between <b>Replace Old Log</b> and
<b>Append To Old Log</b>.  In the first case, if a file already exists
with the same name as the new log file, the old file is lost.  In the 
second case new log information will be appended to the old log file.
<p>
When the log is open, the second button becomes a <b>Start/Stop Log</b>
button.  This can be used to temporarily stop information from being
logged without closing the log file.  The next button is a
<b>Log Comment</b> button which can be used to add a comment to the log file.
<p>
The <b>Show Log</b> can bring up a browser window with containing the log file.
This only works on some systems.  If this button does not work automatically,
you may have to bring up the browser and open the appropriate URL.
<p>
The <b>Gantt Chart</b> button displays a Gantt chart showing the states of
the philosophers over time.  When the log file is open, the Gantt chart
has a <b>Log</b> button which can but am image of the Gantt chart 
in the log file.  The <b>Log Data</b> button becomes active when the 
log file is open.  This puts some tables into the log file containing
statistics from the simulation.
<p>
The <b>Current State</b> button toggles between <b>Truncate</b> and
<b>Ignore</b>.
This affects how the statistics handle the current state of each philosopher.
The ending time of the current state is no known.  In the <b>Ignore</b>
mode the current state is not included in the statistics.  In the
<b>Include</b> mode, the last state is included, assuming it ends at the 
current time.
<p>
The <b>Color/Mono</b> toggles between color and monochrome mode for
saving the Gantt chart.  In the <b>Mono</b> mode, gray scales are used
which might be easier to distinguish when the charts are printed
on a black and white printer.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="Detailed Information"></a>
<h3>Detailed Information</h3>
The <b>Show Details</b> button pops up a window containing information
about the details of the running of the simulation.
Each time a button to start or stop the simulation is pushed, a message
appears in this window.  It shows when each time step starts and ends.
It also show when a philosopher changes state,
and when it finishes eating, it shows what tests were made to determine if
another philosopher can change state.
<p>
This is a standard Jeli Frame which contains a
<a href=../Jeli/widgets.html#JeliTextArea>JeliTextArea</a>
with a button to log the contents of the text area.
<p>
The buttons at the bottom of the window include:<br>
<b>Hide</b> which hides the window<br>
<b>Show Events</b> which shows the pending events for the simulation<br>
<b>Show Distributions</b> which shows the distributions for all of the philosophers. <br>
<b>Show Entry Queue History</b> which shows the times of all items put in and taken out of the entry queue. <br>
<b>Show Waiting Queue History</b> which shows the times of all items put in and taken out of the waiting queue. <br>
<p>

Each philosopher also has a detailed information window which tracks just 
that philosopher.  You can open this window by clicking the mouse inside
one of the large philosopher boxes.  There is a separate window for each
philosopher and you can have as many of these open as you wish.
<p>
The buttons at the top of the window, including a <b>Log</b> button
are the same as for any JeliTextArea.
A colored bar at the bottom of the window matches the color of the 
corresponding philosopher.
Information is not automatically logged in these windows.  You must
push one of the buttons at the bottom of the window.<p>
<b>Show Distributions</b> lists the three distributions for the philosopher.<br>
<b>Show Times</b> lists the three distributions for the philosopher and the
times used so far from each of these distributions. <br>
<b>Show History</b> shows all of the state changes of this philosopher and when they occurred. <br>
<b>Hide</b> hides the window.<br>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="Parallel Execution"></a>
<h3>Parallel Execution</h3>
You can run two or more copies of the simulator simultaneously to 
compare the results with different parameter settings, for example
different algorithms or types of monitors.<p>
Normally the simulator is started with<br>
<tt>java StarvingMain</tt> or <br>
<tt>java StarvingMain configfile</tt><br>
If instead you use:<br>
<tt>java StarvingMain 2</tt> or <br>
<tt>java StarvingMain 2 configfile</tt><br>
Two copies of the simulator screen will appear.<p>
Only the first window will contain the buttons for opening and closing
the log as the same log will be used for both simulations.
An additional button appears which is initially labeled
<b>Step Links Enabled</b>.  This means that pushing one of the 
green buttons for one simulation will cause the corresponding
button on the other simulation to be pushed.
<p>
The <b>Pause/Resume</b> button is now split into two parts,
<b>Pause/Resume This</b> and <b>Pause/Resume All</b>, giving the
option to simultaneously pause both simulations.
