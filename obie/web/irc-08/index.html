<H2>Requirements of the project choice:</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="5">You must implement something dealing with computer security in whatever language you feel
	is appropriate. A few representative suggestions will be given, but I encourage you to develop your own ideas.
	Research that leads to a different or unusual way of implementing something is very, very desirable, although original
	results are not required. Any programming must be substantial enough to demonstrate that you can implement a major
	programming project.</FONT></B></P>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="5">You are expected to do a literature search of journal articles about related work as well
	as research-oriented web sites. I expect you to locate most of your research sources, but I am willing to help
	whenever possible. Don't forget that the librarian, Jeff Wanser specializes in science research sources. He is
	very willing to help you locate material you may need.</FONT></B></P>
	<H2>The<FONT COLOR="red"> best </FONT>projects have been those with the following characteristics:</H2>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="5">1) A specific object or phenomena is selected to be studied. Do NOT think you are going to
	be able to construct a complicated tool in approximately 10 weeks!</FONT></B></P>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="5">2) The specific object or phenomena has not been done by someone else or you have been able
	to improve on what someone else has done. This is not a requirement, but these types of projects normally turn
	out very well.</FONT></B></P>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="5">3) Journal papers and research-oriented web sites that deal with your topic have been read
	and explored in order to investigate what others have done.</FONT></B></P>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="5">4) The project is something the student has felt passionately and excited about. When this
	happens, the necessary time devoted to the project is not work, but fun. Although the IRC carries only 2 hours
	of credit, that amount was chosen to save you money, not to reflect on the amount of time you will work on the
	project.</FONT></B></P>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="5">5) The work proceeds evenly over the entire semester and isn't pushed just at the last moment.</FONT></B></P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P><B><FONT SIZE="5">Even with good progress all through the semester, you will tend to push at the end to add
		some things you just thought about doing. PLAN AHEAD TO ALLOW YOURSELF THE TIME!!!</FONT></B></P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="5">Almost all failures or poor projects have been due to procrastination, a failure to realize
	the amount of time involved in doing a good job, or a failure to seek help in time.</FONT></B></P>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<EM><B><FONT SIZE="5">I. A formal proposal for your project.- Due by at least Friday of week 3 (Septermber 19,
	2008)</FONT></B></EM>
	<P><FONT SIZE="5">You should start reading articles IMMEDIATELY to obtain an idea of what you want to do.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT SIZE="5">This must be approximately a 3 page discussion of how you envision your project. Explain:<BR>
	1) What you plan to implement- to the best of your knowledge right now. <BR>
	2) Why this project is of interest to you. <BR>
	3) Specify any web sites and journal articles you have explored already that are about your topic. You must include
	at least one journal article or convince me there are none available.<BR>
	4) Describe how you plan to implement the project in stages. <BR>
	<BR>
	A staged approach is VERY critical as you will want to have a working project available throughout your entire
	development. Remember, start simple and add complexity to later versions. Always keep a WORKING version of your
	project safe (multiple backups are a good idea) and work on a copy to add enhancements. If you tell me at the presentation
	time that you had a working version last week and now it doesn't work, I will assume you have done nothing and
	your grade will be the same! <BR>
	<BR>
	Be sure to write your proposal (and your paper later) in good, scientific style --- i.e. no &quot;I's&quot;. <BR>
	<BR>
	I am aware that you may be changing your ideas during the course of your development. That is fine, but if you
	don't have an initial vision of your project, you won't make any progress. <BR>
	<BR>
	Many of you have chatted with me informally about possible projects. Almost all informal proposals needed some
	refinement and massaging. If you haven't interacted with me at all about possible ideas, I suggest you do so quickly.
	A mail message is fine to set up an appointment or to explore some ideas.</FONT></P>
	<P><A HREF="mailto: obie@hiram.edu"><B><FONT SIZE="5">mailto: obie@hiram.edu</FONT></B></A><FONT SIZE="5"><BR>
	<BR>
	To get ideas, look at web sites cited as references and search through our textbook. Remember there are many references
	in Safari also. <BR>
	<BR>
	You may be able to adapt some existing code provided you: <BR>
	1) Document the source of </FONT><B><I><FONT SIZE="5">every</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="5"> single line you use that
	is not yours in a way that I can find easily the original code and see it. Failure to do this will be a plagiarism
	violation. <BR>
	2) You have added a </FONT><EM><B><I><FONT SIZE="5">substantial</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="5"> </FONT></EM><FONT
	SIZE="5">amount of coding that can demonstrate your ability to code a large project. If in doubt, ask me before
	you assume you have done enough on your own. If a lot of your code is from another source, you have not met the
	requirements of this course.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT SIZE="5">BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT USING CODE FROM OTHER SOURCES. IT IS EASY TO SLIDE INTO A PLAGIARISM SITUATION.
	ASK IF YOU WANT ADVICE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOUR WORK IS ACCEPTABLE!</FONT>

<B>The following pages are from some former IRCs.</B></H2>
<P><FONT SIZE="5">These will act as background material you might find useful to see the scope of the projects.
The &quot;Description of presentations given to our guests&quot; shows the purpose of the projects and the abstracts
show some of the projects done in previous sessions.. The Evaluation Form may be modified slightly, but the basic
structure will be the same.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="5">Be aware that not all of the abstracts are well done. For example, several incorrectly used the
first person voice. Sometimes a student didn't submit the abstract in time. Then the student was responsible for
supplying copies at the presentation even though points were lost for not meeting the deadline. More importantly,
not all of the projects are well done. To some extend, you can almost spot the poorer ones as the descriptions
are vague, talk about being a work in progress, or speak to what they hoped to do, not what they did.</FONT>

due to a failure to carry out the project in a reasonable fashion (due to waiting too long to start coding), rather
than a failure of the original scope of the project</FONT>
