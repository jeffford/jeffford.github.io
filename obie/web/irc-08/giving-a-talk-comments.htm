<h1> How to give a good research talk: comments by others </h1>

Since publishing this paper in SIGPLAN Notices a number of people
have written to us with perceptive comments and good ideas.
<p>
Here is a collection
of the more substantial suggestions we received, published
in each case with the author's consent.   These contributions are
informal, vary in style, and are only very lightly edited.
<p>
We'd like to thank these
contributors and encouage others to follow suit.

<em>About preparing slides on a computer.</em>
Since we wrote the original paper, several things have changed:

<ul>
<li> Many people have laptops, and conferences now invariably
provide facilities for projecting from a laptop. This means that
you can prepare your slides on a computer and still write them
the night before!  (Or change them on the day, in the light of
some earlier talk.) It also means that you can easily do colour
slides.

<li> Powerpoint has become readily available.  I find that I can
write slides as fast (or faster) using Powerpoint than I can by hand,
something that was not true before. 
</ul>
Together these changes mean that I have recanted on our advice
to hand-write slides.  The disadvantages of using a computer have
largely vanished, while the advantages (e.g. notably, being able to make
changes easily, and being able to distribute slides electronically) remain.
<p>
I've evolved a few tricks to make it easier to prepare slides, which
are on my 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/win32-cheat.html">
Win32 cheat sheet</a>.

If you do find yourself listening to a poorly-given 
research talk don't waste your time doodling but try to get some 
benefit out of it.  Observe the speaker carefully in order to analyse
why it is a poor seminar so that you don't repeat the same mistakes.  
<p> 
Perhaps if the audience at conferences were more observant in this way
then the standard of communication would increase dramatically,
encouraging more to attend even if they are not among the speakers.

Did you take into account presentation packages like Powerpoint,
Harvard Graphics, ...?  O.K. there are problems with last minute
slides, but colour output should be normal nowadays - at least
in a computing centre. 
These tools are "easy to use", they help you to spend your time
on the content, give structural (according to your rules and
always in the same quality) and graphics aids like diagrams,
arrows and more.  They include features
you wouldn't have imagined or wouldn't have
used because perhaps you have no skills in drawing or just don't
want to "spend your time fiddling with your pencil", sketching
N times und duplicating M times because a new idea doesn't fit
into the slide just manually designed, and and and ....
<p>
These tools also allow you easily to reuse and rearrange
and modify your slides, to design a slide show with animation
effects, various kinds of "interesting" revealing line by line
(I hate this peice of paper, too because of this "you can't
be trusted ..."!), and so on.
<p>
I like these tools (LATeX is IMHO the wrong one for this application)
and I think people like it because they very often ask: "how did you
do it".
<p>
One concluding remark: I think your paper is intended to give hints
how to make "good presentations" but then it shouldn't be based on the
"night before in the hotel" assumption --- perhaps a common, but not a
desirable situation.

<h3> Graham Perkins </h3>
While you're about it, what about those juddery nervous people who
insist on leaning against the OHP table or holding the slide or
grasping the OHP itself?  Wobble wobble wobble.  You just get to read
something interesting skating off the top left corner when they whip
the whole lot off and wobble another slide into view.  Works a treat
when combined with jittery "cover-up" technique.
<p>
Watch out for those expensive seminars where organisers hire very
expensive hotel with smart executive seminar suites where the <em>
ceiling is too low</em>!  Result? Screen is below the level of the front
desk and nobody can read it.
     
When I started in teaching, I was sent on a training course for new
lecturers.  The presenter of this course spent here entire time
looking at her slides on the OHP.  Needless to say, they were
projected onto her body, not the screen.
 
And why are there so many professionals who lack the simple spatial
awareness and geometric skills to line up the slide with the lit-up
area on the screen?  I'm fed up trying to read bits of info.  off the
ceiling or wall while there are huge blank areas on the screen!
<p>
I think Microsoft have had a negative effect on research seminars ---
I've been to several where the presentation was entirely designed
using Powerpoint.  It has lots of different colours and shapes and
interesting backdrop effects for your slides, but does tend to lead to
every presentation being composed up entirely from (pretty) bullet
point displays.

<h3> Simon Peyton Jones </h3>
One thought that has occurred to me since writing the paper is this:
never apologise.  Speakers surprisingly often start by apologising for shortcomings
they anticipate in their presentation (e.g. "I havn't
had as much time to prepare this talk as I'd have liked"; or "I don't feel
qualified to address this audience").
Starting in this way is very negative.  Plunge in confidently instead.
<p>
This doesn't preclude being honest about the technical shortcomings of
the work itself (which you should be); but mention them in their place
rather than apologising for them in advance.

<h3> John Ramsdell </h3>
 I would like to give you one piece of
advice I have found often helps others:
<em> a slide cannot be read by the audience unless it
can be laid on the floor and read with ease while
standing tall</em>.
This rule is easy to remember and stays with people.  

<h3> Henry Spencer</h3>
Run through your talk at least once in advance so you know how long it
will take.  It probably needs to be cut down.  My talks usually need to
be cut by at least a factor of two.  Doing this in advance is far superior
to improvising when you discover you only have five more minutes.  Don't
forget to leave time for questions at the end.
<p>
Doing a practice run in front of a mirror can be revealing.  Mumbling,
speaking to your notes, etc. can be fought effectively by speaking only
when you have eye contact with a member of the audience.  Not the same
person all the time, though! 
<p>
Say something interesting.  If you're short of time, pick one subtopic
and say something interesting about it, and forget the rest.  Few things
annoy an audience more than hearing "well, the rest of that's in the paper"
every two minutes.  Especially since it usually comes just as you were
starting to talk about something in enough detail to actually be worth
listening to.  If there isn't time to cover everything well, <em> don't try</em>.
(This is especially true if you find yourself <em> unexpectedly</em> short of
time.  Dashing through half a dozen topics in five minutes means you
can't say anything interesting about any of them.)
<p>
Say something your competitors would find fascinating.  If they wouldn't
find your talk interesting, the rest of the audience probably won't either.
<p>
Remember that your audience can read.  Rather than reciting the results
in the paper, talk about how you got them, especially what problems you
solved and what mistakes you made, or about the implications.
<p>
Plan your slides for visual content.  Pictures should be worth a thousand
words.  If a slide doesn't make sense shown backwards, it has too many
words and not enough picture -- take it out.  The outline of your talk 
belongs in your notes, not on your slides.
<p>
Using visual media for things with visual content also does wonders for
the poor people at the back of the audience who can't read your 3-point
type anyway.  If you <em> must</em> put words on your slides, 24-point type is
about the minimum.  For viewgraphs, stand up and drop them on the floor
at your feet; if you can't read them that way, the print's too small.
<p>
Once when I found I had to cut a talk severely -- by about a factor
of four -- I resorted to writing a full script, literally writing out
every word I was going to say.  This let me time things quite precisely,
and helped a lot in figuring out exactly what would fit.  When I gave
the talk, I didn't follow the script word for word, but it was there to
fall back on if I got stuck.  Too much preparation is better than not
enough.
<p>
Visit the washroom shortly before your talk.

<h3> Tom Verhoeff </h3>

There is one advice about slide making that I find missing.
What I usually do when preparing slides is to take a sheet of A4 paper
and divide it into 4, or even better 8, small pages (of the same
ratio as a slide).  I handwrite my slide texts in my usual (too small)
`font'.  That way you cannot put too much on a slide.  When you
prepare the text of a slide on a single A4 sheet you tend to write
to small and you are led to believe that everything still fits.  With
the artificially reduced page size your usual handwriting is about
the right size and you immediately feel that you cannot include so
much on a single sheet.  Besides, it saves paper.  I learnt this technique
from a colleague, but I have never seen it advertised.

<h3> Michael Wolfe </h3>

We had one student here who was almost
catatonic in front of an audience, and he had to give a presentation for part
of our PhD qualifying exam.  His advisor had him write his entire presentation
(word for word) on 3x5 cards, from which he read the talk.  I also saw another
author do this at a Sigplan PLDI conference a few years ago.  While this loses
points for missing audience eye contact, it is far superior to a poor talk,
which would otherwise have been the result.  So, a last resort for the very
nervous is to write out the talk when they are alone and calm, and then to
simply read it.

<h3> Jacques Cremer </h3>

Just one small point: on slide 31, you have the following advice:
"Point at the screen, not at the overhead projector", which is
of course fine. However, many people point at the (laptop) screen when
projecting from their computer; could be worthwhile to tell them not
to do it!.
