<P>Giving a good research talk is not easy. We try to identify some =
things which=20
we have found helpful, in the hope that they may be useful to you. =
</P><I>This=20
paper appears in SIGPLAN Notices 28(11) (Nov 1993).</I>=20

<P>By a "research talk" we mean a presentation of 30-60 minutes, given =
to a=20
group of people who are motivated and intelligent, but who may not know =
much=20
about your particular area.</P>
<P>The paper is heavily on our personal experience of giving talks in =
the area=20
of Computing Science. What we have to say is quite different from what =
business=20
people are often taught, but perhaps that's due mainly to a difference =
in the=20
style of presentation needed for technical material.</P>
<P>Papers like this one often tend to consist mainly of "motherhood" =
statements,=20
with which nobody could possibly disagree (such as "prepare well"), and =
thereby=20
end up with little real punch. We have tried to avoid this, partly by=20
deliberately overstating some things (the title, for example) in order =
to make=20
our points more vividly.</P>
<P>We make no claim to have all the answers; rather, we have simply =
tried to=20
write down suggestions which have worked for us in the hope that they =
may be=20
useful to you. Everyone is different, so take what is useful for you, =
and ignore=20
the rest.</P>
<H2><A name=3DSay>2 What to say</A></H2><A=20
href=3D"http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/giving-a-talk/givin=
g-a-talk-html.html#Top">Top</A>=20

<P>You should usually see your talk <I>primarily as a ``taster'' for =
your work,=20
rather than as an in-depth treatment</I>. So two very useful questions =
to ask=20
are these:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Who is my primary audience?=20
  <LI>If someone remembers only one thing from my talk, what would I =
like it to=20
  be?. </LI></UL>
<P>If you have the answer to these questions pinned down, you can use =
them as=20
criteria when deciding what to say and what to omit. And don't forget to =
tell=20
the audience the answer to the second question!</P>
<H3><A name=3DExamples>2.1 Using examples</A></H3>
<P>Most of us do research by trying to solve a bunch of related =
problems,=20
finding some suitable framework in which to solve them, and then =
generalising=20
and abstracting our solution. For example, if the problem is to find out =
whether=20
a function evaluates its argument, then a suitable framework might be=20
denotational semantics, and a generalisation might be abstract=20
interpretation.</P>
<P>The Awful Trap is to present only the framework and the abstraction, =
leaving=20
out the motivating examples which you used to guide your work. Many =
talks are=20
far too abstract. They present slide upon slide of impressive-looking =
squiggles,=20
but leave the audience none the wiser.</P>
<P>It is utterly vital to present examples which demonstrate the points =
you are=20
trying to make. When you give a definition of a property, or a =
mathematical=20
structure, or some new notation, give examples to show what the =
definition=20
captures. When you give a theorem, give examples to show what it means =
in=20
practice.</P>
<P>Of course in a written paper you must be careful to fill in the =
details, and=20
state precisely what is going on (though a good paper has plenty of =
motivating=20
examples too). With any luck, your talk will persuade your listeners to =
read=20
your paper, but a talk is the wrong medium in which to demonstrate your=20
mathematical virtuosity.</P>
<P>The need to motivate and illustrate your talk with examples is =
probably the=20
most important single point in this paper, because so many talks fail to =
do so.=20
Ask yourself again and again: <I>"Have I illustrated this=20
idea/theorem/definition/technique/algorithm with an example?"</I>.</P>
<H3><A name=3DPruning>2.2 Pruning: saying enough without saying too =
much</A></H3>
<P>The tension is this: you need to say enough to convey the essential =
content=20
of your idea, but you must not overwhelm your audience with too much=20
material.</P>
<P>The best way out of this dilemma is to adopt a non-uniform approach =
to your=20
talk; that is, treat some aspects in more detail than others. It may be =
painful=20
not to talk about the other parts, but it is better than only giving a=20
superficial treatment to everything, or over-running your time.</P>
<P>Given that there are bound to be people in your audience who don't =
know the=20
area at all, some overall introduction/motivation is usually essential. =
But do=20
avoid the temptation of spending five or ten minutes on rambling =
introductory=20
remarks. Sometimes, for example, people start with a slide listing prior =
work on=20
the subject of the talk, or with an abstract description of what the =
talk is=20
about.</P>
<P>Don't waste time on this --- instead jump straight in with an example =
which=20
demonstrates the problem you are addressing. Remember: if you bore your =
audience=20
in the first few minutes you may never get them back.</P>
<H3><A name=3DTelling>2.3 Telling it how it is</A></H3>
<P>Avoid the temptation to conceal problems you know about in your work. =
Not=20
only is it dishonest: it is also ineffective. A bright audience will =
find you=20
out.</P>
<P>Furthermore, if you are open about the difficulties, you may find =
that=20
someone makes a suggestion which turns out to be just what you need. Get =
your=20
audience to help you do your research!</P>

<P>Use an overhead projector. A research talk is just too short to be =
able to=20
give a sensible development on the blackboard, and 35mm slides take far =
too much=20
preparation. (There are exceptions, of course. For example, in graphics =
talks,=20
35mm slides are often necessary, and sometimes even video. In this case, =

minimise technology intrusion by minimising changes between overheads, =
slides=20
and video.)</P>
<H3><A name=3DTechnology>3.1 Technology</A></H3>
<P>Write your overhead slides by hand, rather than use LaTeX or other=20
machine-based typesetting technology, unless your handwriting is utterly =

abysmal, because:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>It frees you from having to prepare the entire talk before leaving =
for=20
  your trip.Handwritten slides in the middle of a typeset sequence look =
all=20
  wrong.=20
  <LI>It makes it easy to use colour.=20
  <LI>It makes it vastly easier to draw diagrams, add little arrows and =
bubbles,=20
  and so on. Of course this can be done by computer, but it is much, =
much=20
  slower.=20
  <LI>It is all too easy to be seduced by the apparent neatness of =
typesetting.=20
  Remember that time you spend fiddling with the typesetting is time you =
are=20
  <I>not</I> spending on the content.=20
  <LI>Typesetting adds to the temptation to write a slide that contains =
too much=20
  information, because it will still "fit". If you do typeset your =
slides, use a=20
  large font (at least 17pt). Thismakes your slides physically more =
legible, and=20
  usefully limits how much will fit. </LI></UL>
<P>Naturally, there are times when it is better to use the odd slide or =
two of=20
typeset material --- computer output for example.</P>
<P>Use permanent-ink overhead projector pens. This is very important. =
The=20
water-soluble kind rapidly get tatty and smudged (if your hands don't =
sweat when=20
you are speaking your physiology is different to ours), and their =
colours are=20
much less vivid. You can get plastic erasers for such pens, so you can =
still=20
correct mistakes.</P>
<P>Throw away the flimsy tissue-paper backing which come with OHP =
slides.=20
Instead use ordinary paper from your recycling box. They get in much =
less of a=20
mess, and you can write notes on the backing sheet to remind you of =
points you=20
want to make which don't appear on the slide itself.</P>
<P>Consider writing your slides "sideways" (landscape-style). This =
allows you to=20
write larger, increasing legibility, and usefully limits how many things =
you can=20
write.</P>
<P>Overlays (combined with use of colour) can be very helpful when =
presenting=20
complicated examples, because they reduce the amount of new material to =
read on=20
each successive slide. However, much of the advantage is lost if you =
pick up the=20
slides to align them properly: the audience can't keep their eye on the =
old=20
stuff to see what's new.</P>
<H3><A name=3DSilde_content>3.2 What to put on a slide</A></H3>
<P>When writing slides remember that people can read and take in only =
very=20
little information. Six or seven "things" on one slide is quite =
enough.</P>
<P>Slides shouldn't repeat what you plan to say, but they should =
emphasise it;=20
don't waste visual bandwidth on things you are also going to say. People =
who=20
copy their paper onto slides and then read from them are immensely =
irritating.=20
You should plan to talk ABOUT what's on your slides, not read it. (This =
may mean=20
you need separate notes to remind you of what you want to say.)</P>
<P>It is conventional to start with a contents slide, giving the outline =
of your=20
talk. Don't. It takes a precious minute to talk through it, and your =
audience=20
won't understand it till later. Certainly never include such trivia as=20
"introduction", "conclusion". These are understood as a necessary part =
of every=20
talk.</P>
<P>On the other hand, about a third of the way through, it can be quite =
helpful=20
to draw breath with a slide which says ``This is what I have discussed =
so far,=20
and now I'm going on to cover these areas'', or some such. This can help =
to=20
re-orient your audience, and make it clear that this is the moment to =
ask=20
questions if they are lost already. Another way to add signposts is to =
begin=20
each section of your talk with a slide containing only the title of the=20
section.</P>
<H3><A name=3DSlide_prep>3.3 Preparing slides</A></H3>
<P>Don't start writing slides too early. It is Parkinsonian process: it =
simply=20
expands to fill the time available. So don't make too much time =
available. As=20
indicated earlier, we often mull over what we are going to say for a =
week or two=20
beforehand, but only actually write the slides the night before. This =
has the=20
merit that the material is absolutely fresh in your mind when you give =
the talk,=20
though you do need to have a clear idea in advance of what you are going =
to=20
say.</P>
<P>Regard with extreme prejudice the temptation to pull out old slides =
from=20
previous talks, and glue them together into a new talk. It almost always =
shows.=20
Somehow the old slides are never quite appropriate. (It's fine to simply =
repeat=20
a complete previous talk, of course.)</P>

<H3><A name=3Dnerves>4.1 Nerves</A></H3>
<P>If you don't feel nervous before giving a talk, especially to a large =
or=20
unfamiliar audience, you are a most unusual person. Between us we have =
given=20
hundreds of talks, but the feeling that your legs just won't support you =
when=20
you stand up in front of all those people never goes away. Do try =
steady, deep=20
breathing beforehand, and relaxation exercises, but don't expect to feel =

calm.</P>
<P>Remember: the person who just gave that confident, assured =
presentationbefore=20
you almost certainly felt just the same.</P>
<P>If you can make eye contact with your audience, then do so. A talk is =
greatly=20
improved if the audience recognise they are being <I>talked to</I> =
rather than=20
being <I>talked at</I>.</P>
<H3><A name=3DPresenting>4.2 Presenting your slides</A></H3>
<P>Some people hide most of their slide under a piece of paper, =
revealing it=20
line by line, as they go through it. Occasionally this is just the right =
thing=20
to do, but people quite often do it all the time, which we find a very=20
irritating habit. Perhaps it helps to focus you listener's attention on =
the part=20
you are talking about, but it is als rather condescending (``you can't =
be=20
trusted to listen to me if I show you the next line too''). If you find =
yourself=20
wanting to use this technique, ask yourself whether the material would =
not be=20
better split over two slides.</P>
<P>There are exceptions: when you have a punchline to reveal, for =
example, or=20
when you need to emphasise that something proceeds stage by stage; but =
it is a=20
technique to use very sparingly. The inexperienced speaker especially =
doesn't=20
need the extra hassle of messing about with a bit of paper.</P>
<P>An overriding goal must be to make the slides themselves as invisible =
as=20
possible. It is the content that is important. This leads to a couple of =
other=20
don'ts: don't use slides with a rip-off backing sheet; don't use a ring =
binder=20
to hold your slides during the talk, especially if you open and close it =
between=20
each pair of slides; don't switch off the overhead projector between =
slides.=20
Each of these emphasises the existence of the slides as entities in =
their own=20
right.</P>
<P>The only reason you use an overhead projector is so that people can =
see your=20
slides. So don't block their view. For this reason it is often better to =
point=20
at the screen than at the slide. In a big lecture room a pointer can =
help with=20
this, but try not to bang the screen with it -- it makes everyone else's =
eyes go=20
funny.</P>
<H3><A name=3DTiming>4.3 Timing</A></H3>
<P>Don't over-run. It is selfish and rude. Either you will be cut off by =
the=20
chairperson before you have reached your punchline, or you will compress =
others'=20
talks, or you will make everyone late. In any case, you audience's =
attention=20
span is limited, so you probably won't manage to convey much in your =
over-time=20
period.</P>
<P>As you get more experienced, you will learn how long a single slide =
lasts in=20
your talks. The average for most people is probably 2 to 3 minutes. Plan =
a=20
couple of places where you can leave out a bunch of slides, and check =
your watch=20
when you get to them.</P>
<P>It's a good idea to have a couple of slides at the end of your talk =
which you=20
can use in the unlikely event that you finish early, but which you =
usuallyexpect=20
not to use.</P>

<P>So there you have it. As we said in the introduction, our suggestions =
are=20
simply ideas that we have found work for us; we hope they may work for =
you=20
also.</P>

others only in so far as you communicate it to them.</P></BODY></HTML>
