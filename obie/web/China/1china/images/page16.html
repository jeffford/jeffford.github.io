      We arrived at the hotel and were shocked. A huge number of hotel personnel were out to greet Dr. and Prof. Baker! Pictures were taken and hearty hellos given. We thought they had mistaken us for some kind of movie star or rock star.  But, no. We were the first to arrive for the conference and they were so happy to have the conference at this hotel that they celebrated the first arrival.<br>
