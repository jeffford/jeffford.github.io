<h3> Your deliverables for this course will
 be:</h3>
 <hr>
 <ol> <em>A formal proposal for your project.- Due Monday, Feb 12 </em></ol>
<p> This should be a detailed narrative (i.e. don't just list answers to the questions
below) of how you envision your project. Explain
	<br>1) What you plan to model- to the best of your knowledge right now.
	<br>2) Why this project is of interest to you.
	<br>3) Specify any web sites, journal articles, or individuals you have consulted 
about your topic.
	<br>4)Explain why you feel you have the knowledge to understand the scenario
you are proposing.
	<br>5) Describe how you plan to implement the project in stages. 
	
<br>	<br> A staged approach
is VERY critical as you will want to have a working project available throughout
your entire development. It is critical that you start simple and add complexity to later versions.
 Always keep a WORKING version of your project safe (multiple backups are a good idea)
 and work on a copy to add enhancements. If you tell me at the presentation time that
 you had a working version last week and now it doesn't work, I will assume you have 
 done nothing and your grade will be the same! 
<br><br>Be sure to write your proposal and your paper in good, scientific sytle --- 
i.e. no "I's". Imagine yourself convincing your client (or boss) that you are the one
to design the simulation for this project and that it is a project worth doing.
<br><br> I am aware that you may be changing your ideas during the course of your
development. That is fine, but if you don't have an initial vision of your project,
you won't make any progress. Major changes should be discussed with me.
<br><br> Many of you have chatted with me informally about possible projects. Almost all informal proposals needed some refinement and massaging. If you haven't interacted with me at all about possible ideas, I suggest you do so quickly. A mail message is fine.
<br><br> To get ideas, look at web sites, look at the examples in the book, especially in Appendix B.
<br><br> You may use a scenario from Appendix B in the text and possibly enhance it. If
you choose that route, you should be able to give a clearer idea of how you will stage your project.
<br><br> If you don't use an existing scenario from Appendix B, you should concentrate 
more on describing the scenario you plan to model. The more detail you provide the better.
<br><br><em>This Project Proposal is due by midnight on Monday, February 12,  in a mail
message with a Word or text attachment. </em> 
 
 <ol> A revised proposal, if necessary, will be due the next week if I give you some feedback
that requires additional explanations on your part.</ol>

<h2><center> Final deadlines and some more details </center></h2>
<h3> Abstracts: </h3>
 <ol> An abstract of your project will be sent by email to obie@hiram.edu as plain
text - Due Saturday, March 30 at midnight. </ol>
<h3> A few sample abstracts from another course
appear below.</h3>
<li><a href="mon.html">Graphics (1998) </a>
<hr>
<h3> Paper and working project </h3>
 <ol> A paper and working project will be due by Wednesday, April 10. Means of submission of your
.doe files will be explained later. The paper will be submitted as hard copy.
  </ol>
<h3> Paper specifics: </h3>
Details of the format appear below:
<li> <a href="paper.doc"> Paper Details as a .doc file </a>
<ol> Some sample papers are below. Do not view these as the <EM> ONLY </EM>
way to write a paper, but they provide you with some ideas. Note the font size 
is smaller than what is desirable (try font size = 12); you need NOT do the
double columns in your paper; be sure to leave white space for me to use in
writing comments: </ol>

<h3> Presentation April 1-2: </h3>

 <ol> A talk of 20 minutes in length with 10 minutes for questions will be presented on 
an evening in the April 1-2 period. All students in the CPSC 361 course are encouraged
to attend some of the presentations. Friends are welcome to attend, also.
 Be sure to organize your talk so 
you can pack a lot of
 information AND a short demo into the time.</ol>
<ol> All talks are in Colton 106. </ol>
<ol> Signup for talk times will be Tuesday, 3/26, after class. </ol>
<ol> If you are enrolled in the IRC, you are expected to be present for all talks. </ol>
