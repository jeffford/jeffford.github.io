      We took the Gold Dome service which puts you in a domed car with huge windows. Besides the huge windows, we had an inside elevator that would take us to the second level, a narrator who described what we were seeing, preferred seating in the dining car,reserved seats in a domed car, and free soft drinks. It was fabulous.
