<h2>Requirements of the project choice:</h2>









<blockquote>

	<b><font size="5">You must implement something dealing
with computer security in whatever language you feel is appropriate. A
few representative suggestions will be given, but I encourage you to
develop your own ideas. Research that leads to a different or unusual
way of implementing something is very, very desirable, although
original results are not required. Experiments that test security
techniques or tools' effectiveness can be interesting. You might want
to look into the computer forensic area also. You do
need&nbsp;programming that is substantial enough to demonstrate that
you can implement a major programming project. You can't just do a term
paper where you research a topic and fail to create something.</font></b>

	
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><b><font size="5">You are expected to do a literature search of journal articles about related work as well

	as research-oriented web sites. I expect you to locate most of your research sources, but I am willing to help

	whenever possible. The librarian,&nbsp;</font><big><big>Chris Schmidt</big></big></b><b><font size="5">, can help you locate material you may need. You may NOT use only the web for references.</font></b></p>







	
  
  
  
  
  
  <h2>The<font color="red"> best </font>projects have been those with the following characteristics:</h2>





  <b><big><big><big>0) Work on the project is started in the firsst week of the term and continues throughout the term.<br>




  <br>





  </big></big></big></b><font size="5"><b>1)</b></font><b><font size="5"> &nbsp;A specific object or phenomena is selected to be studied. Do NOT think you are going to

	be able to construct a complicated tool in approximately 10 weeks!</font></b>

	
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><b><font size="5">2) The specific object or phenomena has not been done by someone else or you have been able

	to improve on what someone else has done. This is not a requirement, but these types of projects normally turn

	out very well.</font></b></p>







	
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><b><font size="5">3) Journal papers and research-oriented web sites that deal with your topic have been read

	and explored in order to investigate what others have done.</font></b></p>







	
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><b><font size="5">4) The project is something the student has felt passionately and excited about. When this

	happens, the necessary time devoted to the project is not work, but fun. Although the IRC carries only 2 hours

	of credit, that amount was chosen to save you money, not to reflect on the amount of time you will work on the

	project.</font></b></p>







	
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><b><font size="5">5) The work proceeds evenly over the entire semester and isn't pushed just at the last moment.</font></b></p>




  
  
  
  
  <blockquote>

		
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><b><font size="5">Even with good progress all through the semester, you will tend to push at the end to add

		some things you just thought about doing. PLAN AHEAD TO ALLOW YOURSELF THE TIME!!!</font></b></p>

    <hr align="center">

    <em><b><font size="5">I. A formal proposal for your project.- Due by at least 
  Thursday of week 3 (September 15, 2011) You are encouraged to do this as soon as possible and not wait until Sept.

	15</font></b></em>

	
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><font size="5">You should start 
  reading articles IMMEDIATELY to obtain an idea of what you want to do. You need to answer the question, "Can I find reference material on my topic?"</font></p>







	
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><font size="5">The 
  proposl&nbsp;must be approximately a 3 page discussion of how you envision your project. Explain:<br>







	1) What you plan to implement- to the best of your knowledge right now. <br>







	2) Why this project is of interest to you. <br>







	3) Specify any web sites and journal articles you have explored already that are about your topic. You must include

	at least one journal article or convince me there are none available.<br>







	4) Describe how you plan to implement the project in stages. <br>







	<br>







	A staged approach is VERY critical as you will want to have a working project available throughout your entire

	development. Remember, start simple and add complexity to later versions. Always keep a WORKING version of your

	project safe (multiple backups are a good idea) and work on a copy to add enhancements. If you tell me at the presentation

	time that you had a working version last week and now it doesn't work, I will assume you have done nothing and

	your grade will be the same! <br>







	<br>







	Be sure to write your proposal (and your paper later) in good, scientific style --- i.e. no "I's". <br>







	<br>







	I am aware that you may be changing your ideas during the course of your development. That is fine, but if you

	don't have an initial vision of your project, you won't make any progress.&nbsp; <br>







	<br>







	    You may&nbsp;chat with me informally about possible projects. Almost all proposals need some

	refinement and massaging. If you haven't interacted with me at all about possible ideas, I suggest you do so quickly.

	A mail message is fine to set up an appointment or to explore some ideas.</font></p>







	
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><a href="mailto:%20obie@hiram.edu"><b><font size="5">mailto: obie@hiram.edu</font></b></a><font size="5"><br>







	<br>







	To get ideas, look at web sites cited as references and search through our textbook. Remember there are many references

	in Safari also. <br>







	<br>







	You may be able to adapt some existing code provided you: <br>







	1) Document the source of </font><b><i><font size="5">every</font></i></b><font size="5"> single line you use that

	is not yours in a way that I can find easily the original code and see it. Failure to do this will be a plagiarism

	violation. <br>







	2) You have added a </font><em><b><i><font size="5">substantial</font></i></b><font size="5"> </font></em><font size="5">amount of coding that can demonstrate your ability to code a large project. If in doubt, ask me before

	you assume you have done enough on your own. If a lot of your code is from another source, you have not met the

	requirements of this course.</font></p>







	
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><font size="5">BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT USING CODE FROM OTHER SOURCES. IT IS EASY TO SLIDE INTO A PLAGIARISM SITUATION.

	ASK IF YOU WANT ADVICE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOUR WORK IS ACCEPTABLE!</font>

<b>The following pages are from some former IRCs.</b></h2>







<p><font size="5">These will act as background material you might find useful to see the scope of the projects.

The "Description of presentations given to our guests" shows the purpose of the projects and the abstracts

show some of the projects done in previous sessions.. The Evaluation Form may be modified slightly, but the basic

structure will be the same.</font></p>







<p><font size="5">Be aware that not all of the abstracts are well done. For example, several incorrectly used the

first person voice. Sometimes a student didn't submit the abstract in time. Then the student was responsible for

supplying copies at the presentation even though points were lost for not meeting the deadline. More importantly,

not all of the projects are well done. To some extend, you can almost spot the poorer ones as the descriptions

are vague, talk about being a work in progress, or speak to what they hoped to do, not what they did.</font>
