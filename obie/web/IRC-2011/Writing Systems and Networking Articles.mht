<H1>Writing Technical Articles</H1>
<P>The notes below apply to technical papers in computer science and =
electrical=20
engineering, with emphasis on papers in systems and networks.=20
<P>Read Strunk and White, <I><A=20
href=3D"http://www.bartleby.com/141/index.html">Elements of =
Style</A></I>. Again.=20
<P>Give the paper to somebody else to read. If you can, find two people: =
one=20
person familiar with the technical matter, another only generally =
familiar with=20
the area.=20
<P>Papers can be divided roughly into two categories, namely original =
research=20
papers and survey papers. There are papers that combine the two =
elements, but=20
most publication venues either only accept one or the other type or =
require the=20
author to identify whether the paper should be evaluated as a research=20
contribution or a survey paper. (Most research papers contain a "related =
work"=20
section that can be considered a survey, but it is usually brief =
compared to the=20
rest of the paper and only addresses a much narrower slice of the =
field.)=20
<H2>Research Papers</H2>
<P>A good research paper has a clear statement of the problem the paper =
is=20
addressing, the proposed solution(s), and results achieved. It describes =
clearly=20
what has been done before on the problem, and what is new.=20
<P>The goal of a paper is to describe novel technical results. There are =
four=20
types of technical results:=20
<OL>
  <LI>An algorithm;=20
  <LI>A system construct: such as hardware design, software system, =
protocol,=20
  etc.;=20
  <BLOCKQUOTE>One goal of the paper is to ensure that the next person =
who=20
    designs a system like yours doesn't make the same mistakes and takes =

    advantage of some of your best solutions. So make sure that the hard =

    problems (and their solutions) are discussed and the non-obvious =
mistakes=20
    (and how to avoid them) are discussed. (Craig Partridge) =
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI>A performance evaluation: obtained through analyses, simulation or =

  measurements;=20
  <LI>A theory: consisting of a collection of theorems. </LI></OL>A =
paper should=20
focus on=20
<UL>
  <LI>describing the results in sufficient details to establish their =
validity;=20
  <LI>identifying the novel aspects of the results, i.e., what new =
knowledge is=20
  reported and what makes it non-obvious;=20
  <LI>identifying the significance of the results: what improvements and =
impact=20
  do they suggest. </LI></UL>

problem=20
    should include a clear statement why the problem is important (or=20
    interesting).=20
    <LI>Related Work (or before summary). Hint: In the case of a =
conference,=20
    make sure to cite the work of the PC co-chairs and as many other PC =
members=20
    as are remotely plausible, as well as from anything relevant from =
the=20
    previous two proceedings. In the case of a journal or magazine, cite =

    anything relevant from last 2-3 years or so volumes.=20
    <LI>Outline of the rest of the paper: "The remainder of the paper is =

    organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce ..Section 3 =
describes ...=20
    Finally, we describe future work in Section 5." [Note that Section =
is=20
    capitalized. Also, vary your expression between "section" being the =

    <P>The body should contain sufficient motivation, with at least one =
example=20
    scenario, preferably two, with illustrating figures, followed by a =
crisp=20
    generic problem statement model, i.e., functionality, particularly=20
    emphasizing "new" functionality. The paper may or may not include=20
    formalisms. General evaluations of your algorithm or architecture, =
e.g.,=20
    material proving that the algorithm is O(log N), go here, not in the =

<P>It is recommended that you write the approach and results sections =
first,=20
which go together. Then problem section, if it is separate from the=20
introduction. Then the conclusions, then the intro. Write the intro last =
since=20
it glosses the conclusions in one of the last paragraphs. Finally, write =
the=20
abstract. Last, give your paper a title.=20
<H2>Title</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Avoid all but the most readily understood abbreviations.=20
  <LI>Avoid common phrases like "novel", "performance evaluation" and=20
  "architecture", since almost every paper does a performance evaluation =
of some=20
  architecture and it better be novel. Unless somebody wants to see =
10,000=20
  Google results, nobody searches for these types of words.=20
  <P>Use adjectives that describe the distinctive features of your work, =
e.g.,=20
  reliable, scalable, high-performance, robust, low-complexity, or =
low-cost.=20
  (There are obviously exceptions, e.g., when the performance evaluation =
is the=20
  core of the paper. Even in that case, something more specific is =
preferable,=20
  as in "Delay measurements of X" or "The quality of service for FedEx=20

<BLOCKQUOTE>The IEEE affirms that authorship credit must be reserved for =

  individuals who have met each of the following conditions: 1) made a=20
  significant intellectual contribution to the theoretical development, =
system=20
  or experimental design, prototype development, and/or the analysis and =

  interpretation of data associated with the work contained in the =

<H2>Abstract</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>The abstract must <B>not</B> contain references, as it may be used =
without=20
  the main article. It is acceptable, although not common, to identify =
work by=20
  author, abbreviation or RFC number. (For example, "Our algorithm is =
based upon=20
  the work by Smith and Wesson.")=20
  <LI>Avoid use of "in this paper" in the abstract. What other paper =
would you=20
  be talking about here?=20
  <LI>Avoid general motivation in the abstract. You do not have to =
justify the=20
  importance of the Internet or explain what QoS is.=20
  <LI>Highlight not just the problem, but also the principal results. =
Many=20
  people read abstracts and then decide whether to bother with the rest =
of the=20
  paper.=20
  <LI>Since the abstract will be used by search engines, be sure that =
terms that=20
  identify your work are found there. In particular, the name of any =
protocol or=20
  system developed and the general area ("quality of service", "protocol =

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Avoid stock and cliche phrases such as "recent advances in XYZ" or =

  anything alluding to the growth of the Internet.=20
  <LI>Be sure that the introduction lets the reader know what this paper =
is=20
  about, not just how important your general area of research is. =
Readers won't=20
  stick with you for three pages to find out what you are talking about. =

  <LI>The introduction must motivate your work by pinpointing the =
problem you=20
  are addressing and then give an overview of your approach and/or =
contributions=20
  (and perhaps even a general description of your results). In this way, =
the=20
  intro sets up my expectations for the rest of your paper -- it =
provides the=20
  context, and a preview.=20
  <LI>Repeating the abstract in the introduction is a waste of space.=20
  <LI>Example bad introduction: <SMALL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Here at the institute for computer research, me and my colleagues =
have=20
    created the SUPERGP system and have applied it to several toy =
problems. We=20
    had previously fumbled with earlier versions of SUPERGPSYSTEM for a =
while.=20
    This system allows the programmer to easily try lots of parameters, =
and=20
    problems, but incorporates a special constraint system for parameter =

    settings and LISP S-expression parenthesis counting.=20
    <P>The search space of GP is large and many things we are thinking =
about=20
    putting into the supergpsystem will make this space much more =
colorful.=20

  <LI>A pretty good introduction, drawn from Eric Siegel's class:=20
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Many new domains for genetic programming require evolved programs =
to be=20
    executed for longer amounts of time. For example, it is beneficial =
to give=20
    evolved programs direct access to low-level data arrays, as in some=20
    approaches to signal processing \cite{teller5}, and protein segment=20
    classification \cite{handley,koza6}. This type of system =
automatically=20
    performs more problem-specific engineering than a system that =
accesses=20
    highly preprocessed data. However, evolved programs may require more =
time to=20
    execute, since they are solving a harder task.=20
    <DL>
      <DT><B>Previous or obvious approach</B>:=20
      <DD>(Note that you can also have a related work section that gives =
more=20
      details about previous work.)) One way to control the execution =
time of=20
      evolved programs is to impose an absolute time limit. However, =
this is too=20
      constraining if some test cases require more processing time than =
others.=20
      To use computation time efficiently, evolved programs must take =
extra time=20
      when it is necessary to perform well, but also spend less time =
whenever=20
      possible.=20
      <DT><B>Approach/solution/contribution</B>:=20
      <DD>The first sentence of a paragraph like this should say what =
the=20
      contribution is. Also gloss the results.=20
      <P>In this chapter, we introduce a method that gives evolved =
programs the=20
      incentive to strategically allocate computation time among fitness =
cases.=20
      Specifically, with an <I>aggregate computation time ceiling</I> =
imposed=20
      over a series of fitness cases, evolved programs dynamically =
choose when=20
      to stop processing each fitness case. We present experiments that =
show=20
      that programs evolved using this form of fitness take less time =
per test=20
      case on average, with minimal damage to domain performance. We =
also=20
      discuss the implications of such a time constraint, as well as its =

      differences from other approaches to {\it multiobjective =
problems}. The=20
      dynamic use of resources other than computation time, e.g., memory =
or=20
      fuel, may also result from placing an aggregate limit over a =
series of=20
      fitness cases.=20
      <P></P>
      <DT><B>Overview:</B>=20
      <DD>The following section surveys related work in both optimizing =
the=20
      execution time of evolved programs and evolution over =
Turing-complete=20
      representations. Next we introduce the game Tetris as a test =
problem. This=20
      is followed by a description of the aggregate computation time =
ceiling,=20
      and its application to Tetris in particular. We then present =
experimental=20
      results, discuss other current efforts with Tetris, and end with=20
      conclusions and future work. </DD></DL></BLOCKQUOTE></LI></UL>

  <LI>Internet drafts must be marked ``work in progress''. Make sure =
that they=20

  older than six months should automatically be suspicious since =
Internet Drafts=20
  expire after that time period.=20
  <LI>Book citations include publication years, but no ISBN number.=20
  <LI>It is now acceptable to <A=20
  href=3D"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/etc/urls.html">include =
URLs</A> to=20

  author's web page for papers published in IEEE and ACM publications, =
given the=20
  copyright situation. Use it for software and other non-library =

  <LI>References such as <PRE>John Doe, "Some paper on something", =

<H2>Acknowledgements</H2>

<H2>Reporting Numerical Results and Simulations</H2>
<P>In all but extended abstracts, numerical results and simulations =
should be=20
reported in enough detail that the reader can duplicate the results. =
This should=20
include all parameters used, indications of the number of samples that=20
contributed to the analysis and any initial conditions, if relevant.=20
<P>When presenting simulation results, provide insight into the =
statistical=20
confidence. If at all possible, provide confidence intervals. If there's =
a=20
"strange" behavior in the graph (e.g., a dip, peak or change in slope), =
this=20
behavior either needs to be explained or reasons must be given why this =
is=20
simply due to statistical aberration. In the latter case, gathering more =
samples=20
is probably advised.=20
<P>Figures should be chosen wisely. You can never lay out the whole =
parameter=20
space, so provide insight into which parameters are significant over =
what range=20
and which ones are less important. It's not very entertaining to present =
lots of=20
flat or linear lines.=20
<P>The description of the graph should not just repeat the graphically =
obvious=20
such as "the delay rises with the load", but explain, for example, how =
this=20
increase relates to the load increase. Is it linear? Does it follow some =

well-known other system behaviors such as standard queueing systems?=20
<H2>LaTeX Considerations</H2>

  <LI>There's no need to enclose numbers in $$ (math mode).=20

<H2>Things to Avoid</H2>
<DL>
  <DT>Too much motivational material=20

briefly.=20
  <DT>Describing the obvious parts of the result=20
  <DD>"Obvious" is defined as any result that a graduate of our program =
would=20
  suggest as a solution if you pose the problem that the result solves.=20
  <DT>Describing unnecessary details=20
  <DD>A detail is unnecessary, if its omission will not harm the =
reader's=20
  ability to understand the important novel aspects of the result.=20
  <DT>Spelling errors=20
  <DD>With the availability of spell checkers, there is no reason to =
have=20
  spelling errors in a manuscript. If you as the author didn't take the =
time to=20
  spell-check your paper, why should the editor or reviewer take the =
time to=20
  read it or trust that your diligence in technical matters is any =
higher than=20
  your diligence in presentation? Note, however, that spell checkers =
don't catch=20
  all common errors, in particular word duplication ("the the"). If in =
doubt,=20

  <DT>Text in Arial:=20
  <DD>Arial and other sans-serif fonts are fine for slides and posters, =
but are=20
  harder to read in continuous text. Use Times Roman or similar serif =
fonts.=20
  Unusual fonts are less likely to be available at the recipient and may =
cause=20
  printing or display problems. </DD></DL>
<H2>Guidelines for Experimental Papers</H2>"Guidelines for Experimental =
Papers"=20
set forth for researchers submitting articles to the journal, <I>Machine =

Learning</I>.=20
<OL>
  <LI>Papers that introduce a new learning "setting" or type of =
application=20
  should justify the relevance and importance of this setting, for =
example,=20
  based on its utility in applications, its appropriateness as a model =
of human=20
  or animal learning, or its importance in addressing fundamental =
questions in=20
  machine learning.=20
  <LI>Papers describing a new algorithm should be clear, precise, and =
written in=20
  a way that allows the reader to compare the algorithm to other =
algorithms. For=20
  example, most learning algorithms can be viewed as optimizing (at =
least=20
  approximately) some measure of performance. A good way to describe a =
new=20
  algorithm is to make this performance measure explicit. Another useful =
way of=20
  describing an algorithm is to define the space of hypotheses that it =
searches=20
  when optimizing the performance measure.=20
  <LI>Papers introducing a new algorithm should conduct experiments =
comparing it=20
  to state-of-the-art algorithms for the same or similar problems. Where =

  possible, performance should also be compared against an absolute =
standard of=20
  ideal performance. Performance should also be compared against a naive =

  standard (e.g., random guessing, guessing the most common class, etc.) =
as=20
  well. Unusual performance criteria should be carefully defined and =
justified.=20
  <LI>All experiments must include measures of uncertainty of the =
conclusions.=20
  These typically take the form of confidence intervals, statistical =
tests, or=20
  estimates of standard error. Proper experimental methodology should be =

  employed. For example, if "test sets" are used to measure =
generalization=20
  performance, no information from the test set should be available to =
the=20
  learning process.=20
  <LI>Descriptions of the software and data sufficient to replicate the=20
  experiments must be included in the paper. Once the paper has appeared =
in=20
  Machine Learning, authors are strongly urged to make the data used in=20
  experiments available to other scientists wishing to replicate the=20
  experiments. An excellent way to achieve this is to deposit the data =
sets at=20
  the Irvine Repository of Machine Learning Databases. Another good =
option is to=20
  add your data sets to the DELVE benchmark collection at the University =
of=20
  Toronto. For proprietary data sets, authors are encouraged to develop=20
  synthetic data sets having the same statistical properties. These =
synthetic=20
  data sets can then be made freely available.=20
  <LI>Conclusions drawn from a series of experimental runs should be =
clearly=20
  stated. Graphical display of experimental data can be very effective.=20
  Supporting tables of exact numerical results from experiments should =
be=20
  provided in an appendix.=20
  <LI>Limitations of the algorithm should be described in detail. =
Interesting=20
  cases where an algorithm fails are important in clarifying the range =
of=20
  applicability of an algorithm. </LI></OL>

<H2>The Conference Review Process</H2>
<P>It is hard to generalize the review process for conferences, but most =

reputable conferences operate according to these basic rules:=20
<OL>
  <LI>The paper is submitted to the technical program chair(s). Many =
current=20
  conferences require electronic submission, in either PostScript or PDF =

  formats, occasionally in Word.=20
  <LI>The technical program chair assigns the paper to one or more =
technical=20
  program committee members, hopefully experts in their field. The =
identity of=20
  this TPC member is kept secret.=20
  <LI>The TPC member usually provides a review, but may also be asked to =
find=20
  between one and three reviewers who are not members of the TPC. They =
may be=20
  colleagues of the reviewer at the same institution, his or her =
graduate=20
  students or somebody listed in the references. The graduate student =
reviews=20
  can be quite helpful, since these reviewers often provide more =
detailed=20
  criticism rather than blanket dismissal. Any good conference will =
strive to=20
  provide at least three reviews, however, since conferences operate =
under tight=20
  deadlines and not all reviewers deliver as promised, it is not =
uncommon that=20
  you receive only two reviews.=20
  <LI>In some conferences, there is an on-line discussion of papers =
among the=20
  reviewers for a particular paper. Usually, a lead TPC member drives =
the=20
  discussion and then recommends the paper for acceptance, rejection or=20
  discussion at the TPC meeting.=20
  <LI>The technical program chair then collects the reviews and sorts =
the papers=20
  according to their average review scores.=20
  <LI>The TPC (or, rather, the subset that can make the meeting), then =
meets in=20
  person or by phone conference. Usually, the bottom third and the top =
third are=20
  rejected and accepted, respectively, without (much) further =
discussion. The=20
  papers discussed are those in the middle of the range, or where a TPC =
member=20
  feels strongly that the paper ended up in the wrong bin, or where the =
review=20
  scores differ significantly. Papers that only received two reviews are =
also=20
  often discussed, maybe with a quick review by one of the TPC members =
as=20
  additional background. The rigor of the TPC meeting depends on the =
size and=20
  reputation of the conference. In some workshops and conferences, the =
TPC=20
  chairs may well make the final decision themselves, without involving =
the=20
  whole TPC. </LI></OL>
