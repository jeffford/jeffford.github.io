<OL type=3D1>
  <LI><B>Oral Communication is different from written communication</B>
  <P>Listeners have one chance to hear your talk and can't "re-read" =
when they=20
  get confused. In many situations, they have or will hear several talks =
on the=20
  same day. Being clear is particularly important if the audience can't =
ask=20
  questions during the talk. There are two well-know ways to communicate =
your=20
  points effectively. The first is to K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid). =
Focus on=20
  getting one to three key points across. Think about how much you =
remember from=20
  a talk last week. Second, repeat key insights: tell them what you're =
going to=20
  tell them (Forecast), tell them, and tell them what you told them =
(Summary).
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Think about your audience</B>
  <P>Most audiences should be addressed in layers: some are experts in =
your=20
  sub-area, some are experts in the general area, and others know little =
or=20
  nothing. Who is most important to you? Can you still leave others with =

  something? For example, pitch the body to experts, but make the =
forecast and=20
  summary accessible to all.
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Think about your rhetorical goals</B>
  <P>For conference talks, for example, I recommend two rhetorical =
goals: leave=20
  your audience with a clear picture of the gist of your contribution, =
and make=20
  them want to read your paper. Your presentation should not replace =
your paper,=20
  but rather whet the audience appetite for it. Thus, it is commonly =
useful to=20
  allude to information in the paper that can't be covered adequately in =
the=20
  presentation. Below I consider goals for <A=20

<H3><A name=3Doutline>A Generic Conference Talk Outline</A></H3>
<P>This conference talk outline is a starting point, not a rigid =
template. Most=20
good speakers average two minutes per slide (not counting title and =
outline=20
slides), and thus use about a dozen slides for a twenty minute =
presentation.=20

  "abstract" of an oral presentation.)=20
  <LI><B>Outline</B> (1 slide)<BR>Give talk structure. Some speakers =
prefer to=20
  put this at the bottom of their title slide. (Audiences like =
predictability.)=20

  <UL>
    <LI><B>Motivation and Problem Statement</B> (1-2 slides)<BR>(Why =
should=20

knows about=20
    the problem they are attacking.)=20
    <LI><B>Related Work</B> (0-1 slides)<BR>Cover superficially or omit; =
refer=20

people=20

  <LI><B>Results</B> (4-6 slides)<BR>Present key results and key =
insights. This=20
  is main body of the talk. Its internal structure varies greatly as a =
function=20
  of the researcher's contribution. (Do not superficially cover all =
results;=20
  cover key result well. Do not just present numbers; interpret them to =
give=20
  insights. Do not put up large tables of numbers.)=20

  <LI><B>Future Work</B> (0-1 slides)<BR>Optionally give problems this =

  <LI><B>Backup Slides</B> (0-3 slides)<BR>Optionally have a few slides =
ready=20
  (not counted in your talk total) to answer expected questions. (Likely =

  question areas: ideas glossed over, shortcomings of methods or =
results, and=20
  future work.) </LI></UL>
<H3><A name=3Dinterview>Academic Interview Talks</A></H3>
<P>The rhetorical goal for any interview talk is very different than a=20
conference talk. The goal of a conference talk is to get people =
interested in=20
your paper and your work. The goal of an interview talk is to get a job, =
for=20
which interest in your work is one part.=20
<P>There are two key audiences for an academic interview talk, and you =
have to=20
reach both. One is the people in your sub-area, who you must impress =
with the=20
depth of your contribution. The other is the rest of the department, who =
you=20
must get to understand your problem, why it is important, and a =
hand-wave at=20
what you did. Both audiences will evaluate how well you speak as an=20
approximation of how well you can teach.=20
<P>An algorithm:=20
<UL>
  <LI>Take a 20-minute conference talk.=20
  <LI>Expand the 5 minute introduction to 20 minutes to drive home the =
problem,=20
  why it's important, and the gist of what you've done.=20
  <LI>Do the rest of the conference talk, minus the summary and future =
work.=20
  <LI>Add 10 minutes of deeper stuff from your thesis (to show your =
depth). It=20
  is okay lose people outside of your sub-area (as long as you get them =
back in=20
  the next bullet).=20
  <LI>Do the summary and future work from the conference talk in a =
manner=20
  accessible to all.=20
  <LI>Add 10 ten minutes to survey all the other stuff you have done (to =
show=20
  your breadth).=20
  <LI>Save 5 minutes for questions (to show that you are organized). =
</LI></UL>
<H3><A name=3Dother>Other Talks</A></H3>Other talks should be prepared =
using the=20
same principles of considering audience and rhetorical purpose. A =
presentation=20
on a project in a graduate class, for example, seeks to reach the =
professor=20
first and fellow students second. Its purpose is to get a good grade by=20
impressing people that a quality project was done. Thus, methods should =
be=20
described in must more detail than for a conference talk.=20

<P>
<P>Ten commandments (with annotations gleaned from Patterson's talk by =
Mark D.=20
Hill):=20
<OL type=3DI>
  <LI><B>Thou shalt not be neat</B>
  <P>Why waste research time preparing slides? Ignore spelling, grammar =
and=20
  legibility. Who cares what 50 people think?
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Thou shalt not waste space</B>
  <P>Transparencies are expensive. If you can save five slides in each =
of four=20
  talks per year, you save $7.00/year!
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Thou shalt not covet brevity</B>
  <P>Do you want to continue the stereotype that engineers can't write? =
Always=20
  use complete sentences, never just key words. If possible, use whole=20
  paragraphs and read every word.
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Thou shalt cover thy naked slides</B>
  <P>You need the suspense! Overlays are too flashy.
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Thou shalt not write large</B>
  <P>Be humble -- use a small font. Important people sit in front. Who =
cares=20
  about the riff-raff?
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Thou shalt not use color</B>
  <P>Flagrant use of color indicates uncareful research. It's also =
unfair to=20
  emphasize some words over others.
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Thou shalt not illustrate</B>
  <P>Confucius says ``<I>A picture =3D 10K words</I>,'' but Dijkstra =
says=20
  ``<I>Pictures are for weak minds.</I>'' Who are you going to believe? =
Wisdom=20
  from the ages or the person who first counted goto's?
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Thou shalt not make eye contact</B>
  <P>You should avert eyes to show respect. Blocking screen can also add =

mystery.
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Thou shalt not skip slides in a long talk</B>
  <P>You prepared the slides; people came for your whole talk; so just =
talk=20
  faster. Skip your summary and conclusions if necessary.
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Thou shalt not practice</B>
  <P>Why waste research time practicing a talk? It could take several =
hours out=20
  of your two years of research. How can you appear spontaneous if you =
practice?=20
  If you do practice, argue with any suggestions you get and make sure =
your talk=20
  is longer than the time you have to present it.

<P>Commandment X is most important. <I>Even if you break the other nine, =
this=20
one can save you.</I> </P></BODY></HTML>
