          Modeling Clouds Using Particle Systems

     Modeling natural phenomenon in computer graphics is a rather
challenging task. Some examples of the objects are clouds, rain,
and water. The dynamic shape and sometimes chaotic behavior of such
objects presents a unique problem that is sometimes difficult to
overcome.
     Normal representations cannot be used to render such objects;
therefore a special technique must be implemented. Techniques often
used are fractal geometry, texture mapping, and particle systems.
     This program implements the particle systems technique to
model clouds. Particle systems, as the name suggests, represents
the cloud as a large collection of particles. Each of the particles
has attributes which when acting together control the shape and
movement of the system, i.e. the cloud.
     The program proved the task of modeling clouds to be
difficult. The results display cloud-like objects, but gaining
realistic effects remains a challenge.

7:00-7:30 
          Special Effects Using the Accumulation and Stencil
		Buffers

     This project examines the use of the accumulation and stencil
buffers, as supplied by OpenGL. This falls into the category of
advanced rendering and special effects. To demonstrate the
capabilities of these buffers, one effect from each was chosen:
motion blurring with the accumulation buffer, and scene dissolves
with the stencil buffer.

7:30-8:00
          A Geometric Japanese Garden

    Utilizing OpenGL graphics software system, we created an
animation sequence that consists of two separate sections, the
latter having the ability for the user to essentially "move" the
camera through the use of key functions.  Several different methods
for the actual drawing of the first section were explored, as well
as different viewport settings for the two sections.  These
methods, as well as the difficulties encountered in attempting to
utilize them, will be discussed.

8:00-8:30
      Rotating Gears

     This project presents a system of three-dimensional rotating
gears. Five gears of different sizes and colors were implemented
and aligned so they mesh together. The user can rotate the whole
model around any of the three axes using the keyboard. Program uses
one-source lighting. The light source is placed on the right side
behind the viewer. Smooth shading was implemented, which means that
colors are interpolated across surfaces. Normals were defined for
all the surface. In the future, this project will be expanded into
a simulation of a car's gearbox.

8:30-9:00 
          A Graphical Interface for a Visualization System for a
		von Neumann Machine

     When information is complex and voluminous, scientists turn to
visualization tools to help them understand phenomena.  The power
of using visual stimulus to enforce a concept is well known. 
However, the usefulness of such visual tools in teaching basic
scientific concepts has often been overlooked. That a von Neumann
machine executes instructions using a Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle is
common knowledge.  But a detailed understanding of this process is
often difficult for students to achieve. 
     Using general-purpose tools it is possible to create a
three-dimensional, visually stimulating representation of the von
Neumann architecture.  This type of educational visualization
system will provide students with a more intuitive understanding of
exactly how a stored program computer functions. The current
project has involved developing and implementing the graphical
interface for this visualization system.
