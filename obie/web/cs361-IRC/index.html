			<EM>A formal proposal for your project.- Due Monday, Sept 15</EM>
		</OL>
		<P>This should be a detailed narrative (i.e. don't just list answers to the questions below) of how you envision
		your project. Explain <BR>
		1) What you plan to model- to the best of your knowledge right now. <BR>
		2) Why this project is of interest to you. <BR>
		3) Specify any web sites, journal articles, or individuals you have consulted about your topic. <BR>
		4)Explain why you feel you have the knowledge to understand the scenario you are proposing. <BR>
		5) Describe how you plan to implement the project in stages. <BR>
		<BR>
		A staged approach is VERY critical as you will want to have a working project available throughout your entire
		development. It is critical that you start simple and add complexity to later versions. Always keep a WORKING version
		of your project safe (multiple backups are a good idea) and work on a copy to add enhancements. If you tell me
		at the presentation time that you had a working version last week and now it doesn't work, I will assume you have
		done nothing and your grade will be the same! <BR>
		<BR>
		Be sure to write your proposal and your paper in good, scientific sytle --- i.e. no &quot;I's&quot;. Imagine yourself
		convincing your client (or boss) that you are the one to design the simulation for this project and that it is
		a project worth doing. <BR>
		<BR>
		I am aware that you may be changing your ideas during the course of your development. That is fine, but if you
		don't have an initial vision of your project, you won't make any progress. Major changes should be discussed with
		me. <BR>
		<BR>
		Many of you have chatted with me informally about possible projects. Almost all informal proposals needed some
		refinement and massaging. If you haven't interacted with me at all about possible ideas, I suggest you do so quickly.
		A mail message is fine. <BR>
		<BR>
		To get ideas, look at web sites, look at the examples in the book, especially in Appendix B. <BR>
		<BR>
		You may use a scenario from Appendix B in the text and possibly enhance it. If you choose that route, you should
		be able to give a clearer idea of how you will stage your project. <BR>
		<BR>
		If you don't use an existing scenario from Appendix B, you should concentrate more on describing the scenario you
		plan to model. The more detail you provide the better. <BR>
		<BR>
		<EM>This Project Proposal is<B> <FONT COLOR="red">due by midnight on Monday, Sept 15</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="red">
		</FONT>in a mail message with a Word or text attachment.</EM></P>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><I>Your paper and your working project will be <FONT COLOR="red">due by Friday, Nov 14, in class</FONT>.</I></B></P>

		<P>Hand in a hard copy of your paper and all your model code on a CD. Note that this is the week before the last
		week of classes. If you miss this deadline, I will accept a draft of your paper in class Monday, Nov 17. The final
		paper and CD must be in my mailbox by Saturday, Nov 22. Earlier submissions earn extra points!</P>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<I><B>An abstract of your project will be sent by email to obie@hiram.edu as plain text - <FONT COLOR="red">Due

		<P>Some sample abstracts from other courses are given below. Realize these are from an earlier graphics class,
		not a simulation course. Watch your spelling and grammar as I will NOT correct anything!</P>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><I>A talk of 20 minutes in length with 10 minutes for questions will be presented on <FONT COLOR="red">an evening
		og Nov 17.</FONT></I></B></P>

		<P>All students in the CPSC 361 course are encouraged to attend some of the presentations.CPSC 400/401 students
		are required to attend. Friends are welcome to attend, also. I will have a class before that time to talk more
		about what is expected of you for this talk. Be sure to organize your talk so you can pack a lot of information
		AND a short demo into the time.
