6:30-7:00

     Most complex rendering in the OpenGL environment will
incorporate some sort of pattern to visually enhance the appearance
of a particular scene. Because these patternsare one of many
elements that compose a rendering, their generation should not be
the primary focus of the programmer.
     However, if manual generation of patterns using OpenGL
primitives is used, then considerably more code than was originally
planned for could be dedicated to this task. To avoid such
inefficiencies, one can use texture mapping techniques. This
project seeks to demonstrate how a pattern can be generated and
rendered into a scene using OpenGL/GLUT techniques.


7:00-7:30 
         Dream House

     This paper describes how an architectural design can be
modeled using Visual C++ and Opengl.  The program upon which this
paper is based, produces a rendering similar to that of what an
architectural firm would produce --- the only difference being the
hardware and software used to create the rendering. The program
demonstrates the visual presentation capabilities available through
computer graphics, particularly for use in the field of
architecture.


7:30-8:00 
         Designing and Implementing a Virtual Astronomical Orrery
in OpenGL: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Solar System

        One exciting aspect of graphics is the ability to render a
model of a very complex, large scale or abstract systems and
concepts.  From "Jurassic Park" to the latest virtual reality video
games, computer graphics has given us the ability to take the
viewer places they could never otherwise visit. One application of 
computer graphics of specific interest to scientists and educators
is scientific visualization.  Generally speaking, this field
attempts to process scientific data into a rendered image or scene
which displays the original information in an integrated, visual
fashion.
        As an example of scientific visualization software, this
project uses computer graphics to demonstrate the fundamental
motions and dynamics of the Earth's Solar System.  Lighting effects
allow the viewer to observe the mechanism behind the phases of the
planets in a clear, straightforward manner. Texture mapping is
utilized not only to display major surface features on the planets,
but also to create a more interesting environment.

8:00-8:30
         An Interactive Package for Modeling Land
         
     This project set out to develop an interactive package for
biology students to model topography and add graphics to their
presentations. The data was to be gathered through the use of a GPS
receiver that logged latitude, longitude and elevation to a text
file. The program would then create a model of the area the user
had physically walked through. It would allow the user to post
landmarks to the topography and lay down a grid representing their
research area. It would then allow the student to fly around their
model. The program also has the ability to build realistic looking
models of land with very few data points through an algorithm
developed for the program.


8:30-9:00 
         Beginning Graphics for a Game

     This project was inspired by the love of playing games.  We
decided to create a game from an idea conceived while playing an
old shareware game. The old shareware game was text only, which
left our imagination to do the rest.  They did, however, release a
later version of the game that did utilize graphics, poorly, and
not what we had envisioned.  We were not happy with many features
of the game and so decided to develop a new better game. The
conception of that idea occurred long before the graphics class.  
     We conceived a vision of a game, with GOOD graphics, better
features, with network capabilities, and more realism --- as real
as we can imagine about a spaceship battle game. Our objective for
this class assignment was limited when compared to the big picture
of our main goals.  Those main goals, however, influenced how we
designed this class project, instead of one image, we present two. 
The first is a three dimensional image of a starship.  The second
is an image of a radar screen as will be seen by the controller of
the ship.

Last meeting: Wednesday, April 8, 1998, in H-203.
