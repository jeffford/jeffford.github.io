              BRIEF STYLE GUIDE FOR ON-LINE SOURCES

REFERENCE: ONLINE!_ ONLINE! A REFERENCE GUIDE TO USING INTERNET
SOURCES, Andrew Harnack and Eugene Kleppinger, St. Martin's Press,
ISBN 0-312-15023-7, 1997.

<em>APA citations include author, date, and location after the cited
material:i</em>

     Many companies have been successful in using the Macintosh
Power PC in the prepress process (Weisenmiller, 1995, chap. 5)

<em>and a citation in the REFERENCES section: </em>

     Weisenmiller, E.M. (1995). The impact of the Macintosh Power
PC on the prepress industry of the southeastern United States.
&lt http://teched.vt.edu/ElectronicPortfolios/Weisenmiller.ep/
Thesis.html &gt (1996, May 26).

NOTE THE CRITICAL INGREDIENTS OF THE CITATION IN THE REFERENCE SECTION:

1. The author of the page, if given.
2. The date the page was written, if given.
3. The title of the page.
4. The URL of the page 
5. The date YOU accessed the page.

     Other considerations:

<em> electronic mail Viewed as personal mail, i.e. not recoverable </em>

     Robinette, D. &lt robinetted@ccmail.gate.eku.edu &gt (1996, April
30). Epiphany project [personal e-mail] (1996, May 1).

<em> newsgroups </em>
     
     Slade, R. &lt res@maths.bath.ac.al &gt (1996, March 26). UNIX made
easy, &lt books.reviews &gt (1996, March 31).

<em> ftp, gopher, or telnet sites </em>

     In above, substitute for newsgroup name short directions:
&lt telnet freenet.carleton.ca, login as guest, go acn, press 1 &gt
<br>
The point is for all of these: You must provide careful directions for
finding the information that you cited. Information on the internet is
less static than information from traditional sources. Provide
everything you can to help the reader find the source and judge its
worth.
