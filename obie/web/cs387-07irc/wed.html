6:30-7:00  
       Lightning

     The powers of nature have dazzled and amazed humans since the
beginning of time.  From the sight of water falling from the sky to
fire burning away at twigs and bramble, nature is a nurturing beast
with the powers to nurture and destroy human life. Many of the
spectacles of nature are dazzling and horrifying in the same
instance.  Lightning is one of those sights.  The sight of
thousands of volts of electricity connecting the earth and the
heavens is a spectacle of awe.  To simulate this powerful spectacle
on a computer is a difficult task. This project experimented with
different approaches to produce lightning in a scene.

       An Automotive simulator: A Work in Progress.

     One of the things that I have found to be interesting as of
late is the fact that on web sights for the automobile
manufacturers is that they oftentimes give the user/car shopper a
360 degree view of their products.  But you can never see how the
car would look while moving or at night.  This is the goal of my
project.  While still in its simple stages it is my overall hope is
to be able to produce a product that can be used in an application
of this type.  Something that will allow the company to use the
dashboard form their product and allow users the ability to get the
feel of the road.


7:30-8:00 
       Visualizing Random Number Generator Output

     Random number generators are ubiquitous items in Computer
Science. Because of this, some might find it odd that they are also
one of the most under appreciated and under scrutinized items.
Computer Scientists use random number generators every day, but
they seldom take the time to ask whether or not the random number
generators they are using are sufficient or appropriate for their
tasks. These oversights can cause problems. 
     This paper presents a method by which one can visually analyze
the relative randomness of a random number generator. It
accomplishes this by mapping the output of random number generators
to a spherical coordinate system. In a truly random situation, the
objects plotted should show no patterns in their placement within
this coordinate system. When patterns are found, they are signs of
non-randomness.
     The program provides us with a tool for doing such visual
analysis. It should not be thought of as a replacement for
numerical methods of analysis but more as a supplemental tool.

8:00-8:30 
       The Development of a Graphical Representation for a Hockey
          Simulation

     The hockey simulation presented as an Artificial Intelligence
project last year was updated to feature three dimensional
graphics.  The player models were created as articulated figures
and animated using Skeletal Animation. These techniques allowed for
the skater animations to be generated in real time according to the
physics of the game world rather than needing to be pre-created by
artists or through motion capture.  To enhance the appearance of
the game, texture mapping was used to add detail to both the
players and their environment.  Finally, user interaction was
enabled to allow the game to be played.

     On behalf of the students in CPSC 387, I wish to thank you for
taking time from your busy schedule to attend these presentations.
Your comments and questions are very helpful to the students.
