<H2>Requirements of the project choice:</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B>You must implement an animated graphics scene, scenes, or objects using OpenGL, GLUT, and C or C++. As mentioned
	below, research that leads to a different or unusual way of implementing something in graphics is very, very desirable.
	Your programming must be substantial enough to demonstrate that you can implement a major programming project.
	You are expected to do a literature search of journal articles about related work as well as research-oriented
	web sites. I expect you to locate most of your research sources, but I am willing to help whenever possible. Don't
	forget that the librarian, Jeff Wanser, Library 206, specializes in science research sources. He is very willing
	to help you locate material you may need.</B></P>
	<P><B><SUP><FONT COLOR="red">1</FONT></SUP>To pass, you are NOT required to produce animation at the level of these
	clips from Jurassic Park, Geri's Game, and Quake, but you sure can try! Just remember it takes a long time to do
	some of the clips from recent movies.</B></P>
	<H2><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt">The</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 18pt"><FONT COLOR="red"> </FONT></SPAN><FONT
	SIZE="6" COLOR="red">best </FONT><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt">projects have been those with the following characteristics:</SPAN></H2>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">1) A specific object or phenomena is selected to be modeled. Past examples
	have been lightning, a flame, a fountain, a shock wave after a collision, humans skating, a human performing football
	moves, waving cloth, collision detection of cloth with skin, etc. Complicated scenes have often started as a simple
	idea and then expanded. Do NOT think you are going to be able to construct a complicated game or movie-quality
	feature in approximately 10 weeks!</SPAN></B></P>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">2) The specific model has not been done by someone else or you have been able
	to improve on what someone else has done. This is not a requirement, but these types of projects normally turn
	out very well.</SPAN></B></P>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">3) Journal papers and research-oriented web sites that deal with graphics
	have been read and explored in order to investigate what others have done.</SPAN></B></P>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">4) </SPAN>The project is something the student has felt passionately and excited
	about. When this happens, the necessary time devoted to the project is not work, but fun. Although the IRC carries
	only 2 hours of credit, that amount was chosen to save you money, not to reflect on the amount of time you will
	work on the project.</B></P>
	<P><B>5) The work proceeds evenly over the entire semester and isn't pushed just at the last moment.</B></P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P><B>Even with good progress all through the semester, you will tend to push at the end to add some things you
		just thought about doing. <FONT SIZE="5">PLAN AHEAD TO ALLOW YOURSELF THE TIME!!!</FONT></B></P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">Almost all failures or poor projects have been due to procrastination, a failure to realize
	the amount of time involved in doing a good job, or a failure to seek help in time.</FONT></B></P>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<EM><B><FONT SIZE="4">I. A formal proposal for your project.- Due by at least Friday of week 2 (Septermber 7, 2007)</FONT></B></EM>
	<P>This must be approximately a 3 page discussion of how you envision your project. Explain <BR>
	1) What you plan to implement- to the best of your knowledge right now. <BR>
	2) Why this project is of interest to you. <BR>
	3) Specify any web sites and journal articles you have explored already that are about your topic. You must include
	at least one journal article or convince me there are none available.<BR>
	4) Describe how you plan to implement the project in stages. <BR>
	<BR>
	A staged approach is VERY critical as you will want to have a working project available throughout your entire
	development. Remember, start simple and add complexity to later versions. Always keep a WORKING version of your
	project safe (multiple backups are a good idea) and work on a copy to add enhancements. If you tell me at the presentation
	time that you had a working version last week and now it doesn't work, I will assume you have done nothing and
	your grade will be the same! <BR>
	<BR>
	Be sure to write your proposal (and your paper later) in good, scientific style --- i.e. no &quot;I's&quot;. <BR>
	<BR>
	I am aware that you may be changing your ideas during the course of your development. That is fine, but if you
	don't have an initial vision of your project, you won't make any progress. <BR>
	<BR>
	Many of you have chatted with me informally about possible projects. Almost all informal proposals needed some
	refinement and massaging. If you haven't interacted with me at all about possible ideas, I suggest you do so quickly.
	A mail message is fine to set up an appointment or to explore some ideas.</P>
	<P><A HREF="mailto: obie@hiram.edu"><B>mailto: obie@hiram.edu</B></A><BR>
	<BR>
	To get ideas, look at web sites and examine the code in the demo programs in the textbook (and for those with the
	new textbook, the CD), Those who already had the course should have seen many examples so you don't need the CD.<BR>
	<BR>
	You may be able to adapt some existing code provided you: <BR>
	1) Document the source of <B><I>every</I></B> single line you use that is not yours in a way that I can find easily
	the original code and see it. Failure to do this will be a plagiarism violation. <BR>
	2) You have added a <EM><B><I>substantial</I></B> </EM>amount of coding that can demonstrate your ability to code
	a large project. If in doubt, ask me before you assume you have done enough on your own. If a lot of your code
	is from another source, you have not met the requirements of this course.</P>
	<P><FONT SIZE="4">BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT USING CODE FROM OTHER SOURCES. IT IS EASY TO SLIDE INTO A PLAGIARISM SITUATION.
	ASK IF YOU WANT ADVICE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOUR WORK IS ACCEPTABLE!</FONT>

<P>These will act as background material you might find useful to see the scope of the projects. The &quot;Description
of presentations given to our guests&quot; shows the purpose of the projects and the abstracts show some of the
projects done in previous sessions.. The Evaluation Form may be modified slightly, but the basic structure will
be the same.</P>
<P>Be aware that not all of the abstracts are well done. For example, several incorrectly used the first person
voice. Sometimes a student didn't submit the abstract in time. Then the student was responsible for supplying copies
at the presentation even though points were list for not meeting the deadline. More importantly, not all of the
projects are well done. To some extend, you can almost spot the poorer ones as the descriptions are vague, talk
about being a work in progress, or speak to what they hoped to do, not what they did.

to carry out the project in a reasonable fashion (due to waiting too long to start coding), rather than a failure
