<H2>Requirements of the project choice:</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B>You should investigate a topic of interest to you in the area of parallel or distributed computing. You must
	implement some aspect of your project to show that you can manage the development of piece of software that is
	designed and built by you. Research that leads to a different or unusual way of implementing something in this
	area is very, very desirable, but it is acceptable to implement some algorithms that you have studied in research
	papers. Your programming must be substantial enough to demonstrate that you can implement a major programming project.
	You are expected to explore some journal articles about related work as well as research-oriented web sites. I
	expect you to locate most of your research sources, but I am willing to help whenever possible. Don't forget that
	the librarian, Jeff Wanser, Library 206, specializes in science research sources. He is very willing to help you
	locate material you may need.</B></P>

	SIZE="6" COLOR="red">best </FONT><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt">projects have been those with the following characteristics:</SPAN></H2>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">1) A specific object, phenomena, or topic is selected to be investigated and
	is explored in depth.</SPAN></B></P>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">2) Journal papers and research-oriented web sites that deal with parallel
	and distributed computing have been read and explored in order to investigate what others have done. OhioLink provides
	you with access to the ACM Digital Library Portal (see reference below) which contains many excellent articles.
	For example, searching on &quot;simd&quot; and &quot;sorting&quot; produced 200 articles! You can search it off
	campus, but you need a Hiram College machine to access the articles. Similarly, you can search at the IEEE Digital
	Library Portal (see reference below) and read abstracts, but you won't be able to download articles. Check with
	me as to whether or not I have any articles you are interested in.</SPAN></B></P>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">3) </SPAN>The project is something the student has felt passionately and excited
	about. When this happens, the necessary time devoted to the project is not work, but fun. <FONT SIZE="4">Although
	the IRC carries only 2 hours of credit, that amount was chosen to save you money, not to reflect on the amount
	of time you will work on the project.</FONT></B></P>
	<P><B>4) The work proceeds evenly over the entire semester and isn't pushed just at the last moment. In this IRC,
	the learning curve was quite steep and you have 2/3 of semester to work on this. You need to move quickly to pick
	a topic, discuss your choice with me, and start your work.</B></P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P><B>Even with good progress all through the semester, you will tend to push at the end to add some things you
		just thought about doing. <FONT SIZE="5">PLAN AHEAD TO ALLOW YOURSELF THE TIME!!!</FONT></B></P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">Almost all failures or poor projects have been due to procrastination, a failure to realize
	the amount of time involved in doing a good job, or a failure to seek help in time.</FONT></B></P>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<EM><B><FONT SIZE="4">I. A formal proposal for your project.- Due as soon after your discussion with me as possible.</FONT></B></EM>
	<P>This must be approximately a 3 page discussion of how you envision your project. Explain <BR>
	1) What you plan to implement- to the best of your knowledge right now. <BR>
	2) Why this project is of interest to you. <BR>
	3) Specify any web sites and journal articles you have explored already that are about your topic. Youshould include
	some citations to journal articles that might be of use to you.<BR>
	4) Describe how you plan to implement the project in stages. <BR>
	<BR>
	A staged approach is VERY critical as you will want to have a working project available throughout your entire
	development. Remember, start simple and add complexity to later versions. Always keep a WORKING version of your
	project safe (multiple backups are a good idea) and work on a copy to add enhancements. If you tell me at the presentation
	time that you had a working version last week and now it doesn't work, I will assume you have done nothing and
	your grade will be the same! <BR>
	<BR>
	Be sure to write your proposal (and your paper later) in good, scientific style --- i.e. no &quot;I's&quot;. <BR>
	<BR>
	I am aware that you may be changing your ideas during the course of your development. That is fine, but if you
	don't have an initial vision of your project, you won't make any progress.</P>

	<BR>
	You may find you wish to adapt some existing code. It is possible to do this provided you: <BR>
	1) Document the source of <B><I>every</I></B> single line you use that is not yours in a way that I can find easily
	the original code and see it. Failure to do this will be a plagiarism violation. <BR>
	2) You have added a <EM><B><I>substantial</I></B> </EM>amount of coding that can demonstrate your ability to code
	a large project. If in doubt, ask me before you assume you have done enough on your own. If a lot of your code
	is from another source, you have not met the requirements of this course.</P>

	<P>These will act as background material you might find useful to see the scope of the projects. The &quot;Description
	of presentations given to our guests&quot; shows the purpose of the projects and the abstracts show some of the
	projects done in previous sessions.. The Evaluation Form may be modified slightly, but the basic structure will
	be the same.</P>
	<P>Be aware that not all of the abstracts are well done. For example, several incorrectly used the first person
	voice. Sometimes a student didn't submit the abstract in time. Then the student was responsible for supplying copies
	at the presentation even though points were deducted for not meeting the deadline. More importantly, not all of
	the projects are well done. To some extend, you can almost spot the poorer ones as the descriptions are vague,
	talk about being a work in progress, or speak to what they hoped to do, not what they did.
