<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">There is no one way to choose a project. However, first and foremost, your project should
	have the following characteristics:</FONT></B></P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">1. It interests you as you will be spending a lot of time working on it.</FONT></B></P>
		<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">2. It allows you to show off your computer science knowledge AND your management knowledge.
		In fact, we will be looking for both components in your project and that is why there is a contact person from
		both departments.</FONT></B></P>
		<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">3. Just talking about something isn't sufficient. We expect you to implement something - deploy
		software, deploy hardware, implement a data base, etc.</FONT></B></P>
		<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">4. We expect you to reflect on what you are doing and why you are doing it.</FONT></B></P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">Note that strictly web designs have not been good choices as anyone can design using tools
	such as Visual Page. If you are thinking about doing some kind of web design, be sure you are doing something complex
	with it such as interfacing it to a database.</FONT></B></P>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">Some abstracts are provided below from some past projects. Because of privacy concerns, I
	can't give grades for these, but we can chat with you about appropriateness if you want to do something that is
	related to any of these.</FONT></B></P>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">While the project (or some part of a larger project of which you are a part) is to be your
	work, this does not mean that we won't try to provide some help if you need it. Just allow for time for us to research
	a possible answer as all of you will be working on diverse topics.</FONT></B></P>

Note: These are NOT in order of the due dates.</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">I. A formal proposal for your project. Send as an attachment by email to each of the 3 contact
	persons above.</FONT></B> <B><FONT SIZE="4">See details in the Reference section below.</FONT></B> <B><FONT SIZE="4">Must
	be </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="4">approved </FONT></I><FONT SIZE="4">by the end of January</FONT></B>.<B><FONT SIZE="4">
	As most proposals require several rewrites and clairfications, </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="4">please</FONT></I><FONT
	SIZE="4"> interact with all 3 of us early about your possible ideas for projects.</FONT></B></P>

	<P><BR>
	<B><FONT SIZE="4">II. An abstract of your project - Due two days before your presentation. The provided examples
	of past projects are the abstracts submitted by the capstone participants so you should see many examples of the
	desired style. Please check grammar and spelling as they are provided to a diverse audience at the time of your
	presentation.</FONT></B></P>

	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">III. A paper written in a professional research style. Due two days before your presentation.
	Details about the paper are given in the Reference section below.</FONT></B></P>

	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">IV. Maintain a journal during your project about what you are doing, why you are doing it,
	what problems you encountered, what help you required etc. This journal will be very helpful when you write your
	paper. We would also like to have a copy of the journal submitted with your paper.</FONT></B></P>

	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">V. A talk of 20 minutes in length. There will be 10 minutes for questioning after your talk.
	Be sure to organize your talk so you can pack a lot of information AND a short demo into the time. The talks will
	be one night in the 12th week of the semester. The exact date and time will be chosen later. You may invite friends,
	families, employers, and anyone else to the presentation. Refreshments are always served.</FONT></B></P>

	<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">VI. Burn 3 CDs containing all of the above so they can be distributed to Obie, Ellen, and
	Jane. You should hand in two hard copies of the paper so we can return it to you with comments after all three
	of us have graded it.</FONT></B></P>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT SIZE="4">Realize that you will spend a lot more time on the capstone than your credit hours will reflect.
We are very much aware of this, but we were trying to keep costs to you down. As a capstone, this is your time
to show off how much you have learned in your various courses and bring it all together in one project.<BR>
<BR>
Some of you will use projects at your place of work. However, realize that equally good projects have been stand
alone ones when the individual sought out a problem and then solved it for someone. You do need to think about
the management aspect that is required so you can't just do something for yourself --- such as a web page for your
hobby or a data base for some collection of yours.</FONT></B></P>
