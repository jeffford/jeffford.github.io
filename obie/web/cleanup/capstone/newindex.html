<li>Contact person: Dr. Oberta A. Slotterbeck (obie@hiram.edu) 

<h3> Your deliverables for this course will include
 :</h3>
 <hr>
 <ol> <em>A formal proposal for your project. </em></ol>
<p> This must be approximately a 2 page discussion of how you envision your project. Explain
	<br>1) What you plan to implement- to the best of your knowledge right now.
	<br>2) Why this project is of interest to you.
	<br>3) Specify any web sites or journal articles you have explored that are 
about your topic.
	<br>4) Describe how you plan to implement the project in stages. 
	<br>5) How your computer science and management skills will be utilized.
	<br>6) How your project can be judged as successful.
	
<br><br> Many of you have chatted with me informally about possible projects. Almost all informal proposals needed some refinement and massaging. If you haven't interacted with me at all about possible ideas, I suggest you do so quickly. A mail message is fine.
 <br><br> For those doing the capstone this term, I will email your formal proposals to
 the management professors for feedback although it would be good to bounce your
 ideas off of Dean Rose, also. There may be several revisions required for the
 proposal even though the basic idea is approved already.
 For those scheduling capstones in the future,
 you must schedule a meeting with someone both in the management department
 and in our department prior to the 
term in which you plan to do the work. For our department, email contact may 
take the place of a face-to-face meeting. Contact Dean Rose about details concerning
the management department and who to contact. Management may have some additional
requirements.
 <ol> An abstract of your project - Due two days before your
 presentation </ol>
 <ol> A paper written in a journal style- Due two days before your
 presentation. 
 </ol>
 <ol> A talk of 20 minutes in length. There will be 10 minutes for
 questioning. Be sure to organize your talk so you can pack a lot of
 information AND a short demo in to the time. </ol>
