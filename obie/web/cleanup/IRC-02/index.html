<H2>Requirements of the project choice:</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B>You must implement an animated graphics scene, scenes, or objects using OpenGL and C. As mentioned below,
	research that leads to a different way or unusual way of implementing something in graphics is very, very desirable.
	Your programming must be substantial enough to demonstrate that you can implement a major programming project.
	You are expected to explore some journal articles about related work as well as research-oriented web sites. I
	expect you to locate most of your research sources, but I am willing to help whenever possible. Don't forget that
	the librarian, Jeff Wanser, Library 206, specializes in science research sources. He is very willing to help you
	locate material you may need.</B></P>
	<P><B><SUP><FONT COLOR="red">1</FONT></SUP>To pass, you are NOT required to produce animation at the level of these
	clips from Jurassic Park, Geri's Game, and Quake, but you sure can try! Just remember how long I said it takes
	to do some of the clips from recent movies.</B></P>
	<H2><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt">The</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 18pt"><FONT COLOR="red"> best </FONT></SPAN><SPAN
	STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt">projects have been those with the following characteristics:</SPAN></H2>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">1) A specific object or phenomena is selected to be modeled. Past examples
	have been lightning, a flame, a fountain, a shock wave after a collision, a human skating, a human performing football
	moves, waving cloth, collision detection of cloth with skin, etc. Complicated scenes have often started as a simple
	idea and then expanded. Do NOT think you are going to be able to constructed a complicated game or movie-quality
	feature in approximately 10 weeks!</SPAN></B></P>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">2) The specific model has not been done by someone else or you have been able
	to improve on what someone else has done.</SPAN></B></P>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">3) Journal papers and research-oriented web sites that deal with graphics
	have been read and explored in order to investigate what others have done.</SPAN></B></P>
	<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt">4) </SPAN>The project is something the student has felt passionately and excited
	about.</B></P>
	<P><B>5) The work proceeds evenly over the entire semester and isn't pushed just at the last moment.</B></P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P><B>Even with good progress all through the semester, you will tend to push at the end to add some things you
		just thought about doing. <SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt">PLAN AHEAD TO ALLOW YOURSELF THE TIME!!!</SPAN></B></P>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<EM><B><FONT SIZE="4">I. A formal proposal for your project.- Due Wednesday of week 3 (September 11, 2002)</FONT></B></EM>
	<P>This must be approximately a 3 page discussion of how you envision your project. Explain <BR>
	1) What you plan to implement- to the best of your knowledge right now. <BR>
	2) Why this project is of interest to you. <BR>
	3) Specify any web sites and journal articles you have explored already that are about your topic. You must include
	at least one journal article or convince me there are none available.<BR>
	4) Describe how you plan to implement the project in stages. <BR>
	<BR>
	A staged approach is VERY critical as you will want to have a working project available throughout your entire
	development. Remember, start simple and add complexity to later versions. Always keep a WORKING version of your
	project safe (multiple backups are a good idea) and work on a copy to add enhancements. If you tell me at the presentation
	time that you had a working version last week and now it doesn't work, I will assume you have done nothing and
	your grade will be the same! <BR>
	<BR>
	Be sure to write your proposal (and your paper later) in good, scientific style --- i.e. no &quot;I's&quot;. <BR>
	<BR>
	I am aware that you may be changing your ideas during the course of your development. That is fine, but if you
	don't have an initial vision of your project, you won't make any progress. <BR>
	<BR>
	Many of you have chatted with me informally about possible projects. Almost all informal proposals needed some
	refinement and massaging. If you haven't interacted with me at all about possible ideas, I suggest you do so quickly.
	A mail message is fine to set up an appointment or to explore some ideas. <A HREF="mailto: obie@hiram.edu">mailto:
	obie@hiram.edu</A><BR>
	<BR>
	To get ideas, look at web sites and examine the code in the demo programs in the textbook (and for those with the
	new textbook, the CD), Those who already had the course should have seen many examples so you don't need the CD.<BR>
	<BR>
	You may be able to adapt some existing code provided you: <BR>
	1) Document the source of <B><I>every</I></B> single line you use that is not yours in a way that I can find easily
	the original code and see it. Failure to do this will be a plagiarism violation. <BR>
	2) You have added a <EM><B><I>substantial</I></B> </EM>amount of coding that can demonstrate your ability to code
	a large project. If in doubt, ask me before you assume you have done enough on your own. If a lot of your code
	is from another source, you have not met the requirements of this course.</P>
	<P><FONT SIZE="4">BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT USING CODE FROM OTHER SOURCES. IT IS EASY TO SLIDE INTO A PLAGIARISM SITUATION.
	ASK IF YOU WANT ADVICE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOUR WORK IS ACCEPTABLE!</FONT>
	<H4><EM>This Project Proposal is due by Wednesday, September 11, in a mail message to me. I prefer a text version
	extracted from a Word document, not a Word attachment.</EM>

	<P>Comment made in 1998: I did not edit any of the abstracts so if you see spelling or grammar errors now, and
	some of you should ;-), it is too late!</P>
	<P>Comment made 1/10/2001: Not all projects were acceptable, but most of the difficulties where due to a failure
	to carry out the project in a reasonable fashion (due to waiting too long to start coding), rather than a failure
	of the original scope of the project.
