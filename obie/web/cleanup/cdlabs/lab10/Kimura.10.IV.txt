This is a file that should be checked carefully.
Some lines in this file have duplicated or triplicated words.
If a word appears in the line twice, the word is duplicatd ed.
If it is repeated thrice, it is triplicated.    (thrice is three).
For example, the following line has duplicated words.
The dub plicated words are hard to find, but grp   ep can find them for you.
However, you need to write the regular expression very carefully.
