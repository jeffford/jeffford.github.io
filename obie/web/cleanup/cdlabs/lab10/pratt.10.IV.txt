This is a file is that is should be checked carefully.
Some lines in this file have duplicated or triplicated words.
If a word appears in the line twice, the word is duplicated.
If it is repeated thrice, it is triplicated (thrice is three).
For example, the following line has duplicated words.
The duplicated words are hard to find, but grep can find them for you.
However, you need to write the regular expression very carefully.
