session.
L.II.3 -In this section, I was told to add some text, change some text, and
delete some text. 
	To add some text, I used arrow keys to get to the line, and if the new
materials were to be entered, then I used "o". I also used "i, I, A, a, and O"
depending on where the changes were going to be made. 
	To change some text, I used arrow keys to get to the part that were to
be changed, used the command "x" to delete the characters. I then entered the
command "i" to type something to replace the deleted space.
	To delete some text, I used the command "x" to delete few characters,
however, when I wanted to delete a whole line, I used "dd".
