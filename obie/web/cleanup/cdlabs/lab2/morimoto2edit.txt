Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent
a new netion, convceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great war,
testing whether that naion, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated
can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that wart. We have 
come to didicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for
those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
It is altogehter fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a

larger sense, we cannot dedicate nor consecrate, we cannot hallow,
this ground. The brave men, who died here, who struggled here have
consecrated it far above our power to add or detect. The world will
little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget
what they did here

It is for us the the living, rahter to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. IT is
rahter for us, to behere didicated to the great task remaining before
us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause
for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this
nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and and that government
of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish firm the 
earth.
