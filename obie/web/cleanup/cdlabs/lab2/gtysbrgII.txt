Four score and seven years a go our father brought fourth onthis continent
a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great war,
testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated 
can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have 
come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for 
those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.

It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a
larger sense, we cannot dedicate nor consecrate, we cannot hallow,
this groud. The brave men, who died here, who struggled here have
consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The world will 
little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget 
what they did here.

It is for us the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is
rather for us, to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before
us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause
for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this
nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government
of the prople, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
earth.
