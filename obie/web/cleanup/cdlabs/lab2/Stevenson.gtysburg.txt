Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Now we are engaged in a great war, testing whether our nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can last.  We are met on a great battlefield of that war.  We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who gave their lives that their nation might live.
