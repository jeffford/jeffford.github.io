	<H2>Homework Assignments:</H2>
	<P>Assigned Weekend 1: Jot down notes for the exercises in Chpt 2, 3, and 4 skipping the obvious ones dealing with
	projects and outside readings. We will discuss some of these in class next time, but I want you to think about
	most of these. Your notes are for you to read, not me, but I do want to see that you have made some notes!! <BR>
	Be sure you have installed Visual Thought and looked over its use.</P>

	<H2>Group Project:</H2>
	<LI><A HREF="http://cs.hiram.edu/%7Eobie/cs359/CaseStudy02.doc">Case Study by Lisa Miller</A>
	<LI>Assignment 1: (Start in class 2/10/02) Form a group of 3-4 people. You should choose a team leader, a name,
	and make plans for meeting outside of class. <BR>
	Read the case study. Discuss possible ways of helping Consolidated Industries and decide on a scope for the project.
	Produce a DataFlow Diagram of the current system that is within your chosen scope. Drill down on a few of the processes
	until you reach a primitive diagram. Be prepared to present your team's results during the next class time.
	<LI>Assignment 2: As you can see, many of you chose too big a scope. Redefine your scope and redo Assignment 1
	so you have a reasonable DFD! Be prepared to present your team's results during the next class time.
	<LI>Assignment 3: Decide which parts of the system your team modeled in its current DFD should be computerized.
	Draw a DFD for this new system. (Big hint coming out of the discussion last week: Think small, but not so small
	you don't do anything!!!)Be prepared to present your team's results during the next class time.
	<LI>Assignment 4: Choose the model you plan to computerize. Perform the 3 steps of OOA on it for the last weekend.
	In particular, do <BR>
	A use-case diagram <BR>
	Noun extraction and class diagram <BR>
	A state diagram for one of the classes. <BR>
	Supplying E-R diagrams and any of the other OOA documents would be very desirable.
	<P>You will have 10 minutes to discuss your results in the last class period. There will be 5 minutes for questioning.
	In addition, compare and contrast structured analysis and object-oriented analysis as well as your team interactions.</P>
