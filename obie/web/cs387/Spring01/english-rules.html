                OFTEN FORGOTTEN RULES OF ENGLISH

* Avoid alliteration. Always.

* Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.

* Avoid cliches like the plague.

* Contractions aren't necessary.

* It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.

* Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.

* Don't be redundant; don't use more words than necessary; it's
highly superfluous.

* Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.

* Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.

* Who needs rhetorical questions?
